an urn was dug up near the town, which contained a
thousand <em>denarii</em>, ranging from Antoninus Pius to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Philip; and others have since been found. In the
Anglo-Saxon time Brighthelmstone was a manor, and
the great Earl Godwin succeeded in the lordship of
it to his father, Ulnoth. On his banishment from the
kingdom, this manor, with his other possessions, was
seized by King Edward, but, afterwards, he recovered
it, and held it until his death, on April 14, 1053,
when it lapsed into the hands of his son Harold,
who held it until his death at the Battle of Senlac, on
October 14, 1066.</p>

<p>I should rather say that Harold held two of the three
manors of Brighthelmstone, for his father, Godwin, had
given the other to a man named Brictric, for his life
only. This was the manor called 'Brighthelmstone-Lewes;'
the other two were 'Michel-ham' and 'Atlyngworth.'
It is thus described in Domesday Book,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1086:</p>

<p>'Ralph holds of William (de Warren<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) Bristelmestune.
Brictric held it from the gift of Earl Godwin. In the

<p>'Three aloarii (customary tenants) held it of King

them had a hall, and the villeins held the portions of
the other two. The land is 5 carucates, and is in one
manor. In demesne one carucate and a half, and 14
villeins and 21 bordars, with 3 carucates and a half;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

<p>'In the time of King Edward it was worth 10 pounds,

<p>We thus see how small was the population of the
three manors in the time of William the Conqueror,
and it is useful to note that there is no mention whatever
of fisheries or fishermen except the Gabel of herrings.
Concerning this matter Lee<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> propounds a very
interesting theory. He says:</p>

<p>'From the surnames of some of the most ancient
families in the town of <em>Brighthelmston</em>, the phrase and
pronunciation of the old natives, and some peculiar
customs there, it has, with great probability, been conjectured,
that the town had, at some distant period,
received a colony of <em>Flemings</em>. This might have
happened soon after the Conquest, for we read of a
great inundation of the sea, about that time, in
<em>Flanders</em>; and such of the inhabitants of the deluged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
country as wanted new habitations could not have anywhere
applied with a greater likelihood of success than
in <em>England</em>. <em>Matilda</em>, Queen of <em>William</em> the <em>Conqueror</em>,
was their countrywoman, being daughter to <em>Baldwin</em>,
Earl of <em>Flanders</em>. At her request, <em>William de Warren</em>,
her son-in-law, would have readily given a band of
those distrest emigrants a settlement on one of his
numerous manors; and, as they had been inhabitants
of the maritime part of <em>Flanders</em>, and lived chiefly by
fishing, <em>Brighthelmston</em> was the most desirable situation
for them within the territory of that nobleman.</p>

<p>'The <em>Flemings</em>, thus settled at <em>Brighthelmston</em>, were
led, by habit and situation, to direct their chief attention
to the fishery of the Channel. Besides obtaining a
plentiful supply of fresh fish of the best kind and
quality for themselves and their inland neighbours,
they, every season, cured a great number of herrings,
and exported them to several parts of the Continent,
where the abstinence of Lent, vigils, and other meagre
days, insured them a constant market. The inhabitants
of the town, now classed into <em>landsmen</em> and
<em>seamen</em>, or <em>mariners</em>, profited respectively by the advantages
of their situation. The former, whose dwellings
covered the <em>Cliff</em>, and part of the gentle acclivity
behind it, drew health and competence from a fertile
soil. The latter, residing in two streets under the
<em>Cliff</em>, found as bountiful a source of subsistence and
profit in the bosom of the sea. In process of time the
<em>mariners</em> and their families had increased so far as to
compose more than two-thirds of the population of the
town, and had a proportionate share of the offices and
internal regulation of the parish.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The people of Brighthelmstone were subject, in
common with all the coast, to invasion and reprisals to
the English raids on France, and their ships and boats
were occasionally taken, and their fishery interrupted.
In 1377 the French harried the South Coast, spoiled
the Isle of Wight, and burnt Rye, Portsmouth, Dartmouth,
Plymouth, and Hastings. There is no record
of Brighthelmstone being attacked, but the French
came parlously near, as Holinshed tells us: 'Winchelsie
they could not win, being valiantlie defended by
the abbat of Battell and others. After this, they landed,
one day, not far from the abbeie of Lewes, at a place
called Rottington (Rottingdean), where the prior of
Lewes and two knights, the one named sir Thomas
Cheinie, and the other, sir John Falleslie, having
assembled a number of the countrie people, incountred
the Frenchmen, but were overthrowen; so that there
were slaine about an hundred Englishmen; and the
prior, with the two knights, and an esquier called John
Brokas, were taken prisoners, but yet the Frenchmen
lost a great number of their owne men at this conflict,
and so, with their prisoners, retired to their ships and
gallies, and, after, returned into France.'</p>

<p>As far as I have read, Brighthelmstone had peace
until 1514, when Holinshed tells us: 'About the same
time, the warres yet continuing betweene England and
France, Prior Jehan (of whom ye have heard before in
the fourth yeere of this King's reigne), a great capteine
of the French navie, with his gallies and foists<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
with great basilisks<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and other artillerie, came on the
borders of Sussex, in the night season, at a poore village
there, called Brighthelmston, and burnt it, taking such
goods as he found. But, when the people began to
gather, by firing the becons, Prior Jehan sounded his
trumpet, to call his men aboord, and by that time it
was daie. Then certeine archers that kept the watch,
folowed Prior Jehan to the sea, and shot so fast, that
they beat the gallie men from the shore; and wounded
manie in the foist; to the which Prior Jehan was constreined
to wade, and was shot in the face with an
arrow, so that he lost one of his eies, and was like to
have died of the hurt; and, therefore, he offered his
image of wax before our ladie at Bullongne, with the
English arrow in the face for a miracle.'</p>

<p>These archers, who so stoutly resisted the French,
were, according to Lee, the land-owners and others of
the adjacent country, as well as the inhabitants of the
sea-coast, who were obliged to keep <em>watch</em> and <em>ward</em>
whenever there was the least appearance of danger.
The <em>Watch</em>, called <em>Vigiliæ minutæ</em>, in the King's mandate
to the Sheriff, was nocturnal, and seldom exacted,
unless an immediate descent was apprehended. The
<em>Ward</em> consisted of men-at-arms, and <em>hobilers</em>, or <em>hoblers</em>.
The latter were persons who seem to have been bound
to perform that service by the nature of their tenure.
They were a sort of light cavalry, dressed in jackets
called <em>hobils</em>, and mounted on fleet horses. The bold
stand made against the French who landed at Rottingdean
in 1377 was principally by the <em>Watch</em> and <em>Ward</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of this coast, which had been divided into districts,
entrusted to the care of some baron or religious house
by certain Commissioners called <em>Rectores Comitatus</em>.
Thus it was that the Prior of Lewes and the Abbot of
Battle were placed at several times at the head of an
armed power, to oppose actual or threatened invasion.
Certain hundreds and boroughs were also obliged,
under pain of forfeiture, or other penalty, to keep the
beacons in proper condition, and to fire them at the
approach of an enemy, in order to alarm and assemble
the inhabitants of the Weald.</p>

<p>Brighthelmstone had yet another hostile visit from
the French, and to this we are indebted for the earliest
recorded view of the town. It occurred in 1545, and
Holinshed gives us the following short and pithy
account of the affair.</p>

<p>'After this, the eighteenth of Julie, the admerall of
France, monsieur Danebalte, hoised up sailes, and with
his whole navie came forth into the seas, and turned on
the coast of Sussex before Bright Hampsteed; and set
certein of his soldiers on land, to burne and spoile the
countrie: but the beacons were fired, and the inhabitants
thereabouts came downe so thicke, that the
Frenchmen were driven to flie with losse of diverse of
their numbers; so that they did little hurt there.'</p>

<img src="images/i_009fp_thumb.jpg"  alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">ATTACK MADE BY THE FRENCH FLEET UPON BRIGHTHELMSTONE, 1545.</div>
</div>

<p>The French then tried the Isle of Wight, and got
the worst of it, so returned to Sussex. 'The French
Capteins having knowledge by certeine fishermen, whom
they tooke, that the King was present, and so huge a
power readie to resist them, they disanchored, and drew
along the coast of Sussex; and a small number of them
landed againe in Sussex, of whome, few returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
their ships: for diverse gentlemen of the countrie, as
sir Nicholas Pelham and others, with such power as
was raised upon the sudden, tooke them up by the
waie, and quickelie distressed them. When they had
searched everie where by the coast, and saw men still
readie to receive them with battell, they turned sterne,
and so got them home againe without anie act acheived
worthie to be mentioned. The number of the Frenchmen
was great, so that diverse of them that were taken
prisoners in the Ile of Wight, and in Sussex, did report
that they were three score thousand.'</p>

<p>This descent on Brighthelmstone is admirably shown
in a water-colour drawing on parchment in the MS.
Department of the British Museum (Cotton MSS.,
Aug. 1, vol. i. 18), which measures 3 feet by 2 feet; it
is here reproduced. A tracing of it was engraved in
'Archæologia,' vol. xxiv., p. 298, as an illustration of a
paper read by Sir Henry Ellis before the Society of
Antiquaries, April 14, 1831.</p>

<p>Here we find the town, <em>apparently</em>, just where it is
now, with a 'felde in the midle of the towne,' but with
some houses on the beach opposite what is now Pool
Valley, on the east side of which houses the French are
landing. The following are the explanations inserted
in the drawing:</p>

<p>In consequence of this attack, Lee says that 'The
town of <em>Brighthelmston</em>, thus harassed by frequent
alarm, and the desultory attacks of an active enemy,
resolved to erect fortifications, which might afford them
some protection in future. Accordingly, at a Court
Baron held for the manor of Brighthelmstone-Lewes, on
the 27th of September, 1558, the Lords of the manor
granted to the inhabitants of the town, a parcel of land
on the cliff between Blacklyon street and Ship street,
and about two hundred and sixteen yards westward
from the lower end of East street, thirteen feet in
length and sixteen feet in breadth, to build thereon a
storehouse for armour and ammunition, afterwards called
the <em>Blockhouse</em>. This parcel, however, was only part of
the site of that building; for, at a Court Baron held
for the Manor of <em>Atlyngworth</em>, on the 3rd day of January
1613, the homage presented that the north side of the
said building stood on the demesne lands of that manor.
The <em>Blockhouse</em>, the walls of which were about eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
feet in thickness, and eighteen feet in height, was
circular, and measured 50 feet in diameter. Several
arched apartments in its thick walls were repositories
for the powder and other ammunition for the defence
of the town. In front of it, towards the sea, was a little
battery called the <em>Gun Garden</em>, on which were mounted
four pieces of large iron ordnance. Adjoining the
<em>Blockhouse</em>, on the east, stood the <em>Townhouse</em>, with a
dungeon under it for the confinement of malefactors.
From the summit of this building rose a turret, on
which the town clock was fixed.</p>

<p>'At the same time, with the <em>Blockhouse</em>, were erected
four Gates of freestone (three of which were arched)
leading from the Cliff to that part of the town which
lay under it; <i>viz.</i> the <em>East-gate</em> at the lower end of
<em>East-street</em>; the <em>Portal</em>, vulgarly miscalled the <em>Porter's-gate</em>,
which was less than any of the others, and stood
next the <em>East-gate</em>; the <em>Middle-gate</em>, opposite the end
of <em>Middle-street</em>, commonly called the <em>Gate of all nations</em>;
and the <em>West-gate</em>, which stood at the end of <em>West-street</em>.
From the <em>East-gate</em>, westward, there was, at the same
time, a wall built about fifteen feet high, and four
hundred feet long, where the <em>Cliff</em> was most easy of
ascent: and, from the termination of that wall, a
parapet, three feet high, was continued on the verge
of the <em>Cliff</em> to the <em>West-gate</em>, with embrasures for
cannon. The <em>Blockhouse</em> was built at the expense of
the mariners of the town; but the gates and walls seem
to have been erected partly, if not wholly, at the expense
of Government.</p>

<p>'The upland part of the town, thus effectually secured
on the south, might also, in case of any emergency, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
rendered pretty secure on its three other sides, by cutting
trenches at the ends of the streets which led into the
town; or barring the enemy's entrance with lumber
carriages and household furniture, while the inhabitants
annoyed them from every quarter.'</p>

<p>From 1545 to 1586 Brighthelmstone lived in peace;
but when rumours of the Spanish Armada, which was
in preparation, began to be bruited about, the town's
folk had a scare, for a fleet of fifty vessels were descried
off the town, apparently waiting for a favourable opportunity
of landing. The terrified inhabitants lit the
beacons, and sent off, post haste, to Lord Buckhurst,
the Lord Lieutenant of the county, for assistance and
protection. His lordship immediately attended with
as many armed men as he could hurriedly muster, and
posted them on the brow of the cliff between Brighthelmstone
and Rottingdean, so that he might oppose
the enemy should they try to land at either place.
During the ensuing night, his force increased to the
number of 1,600 men, and a considerable number of
Kentish men were on their march to join him. However,
when morning dawned, the ships were still there,
but no one on board seemed to show any disposition to
land; so a few boats belonging to the town plucked up
heart of grace, and ventured out a little way to reconnoitre
this fleet, when they discovered, to their very
great joy, that it only consisted of Dutch merchantmen,
laden with Spanish wines, detained in the Channel by
contrary winds!</p>

<p>But at the end of July, 1558, when the Armada was
an accomplished fact, Brighthelmstone went to work in
earnest to defend itself; and they then had in the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
belonging to the Government, six pieces of great iron
ordnance and ten 'qualivers.'<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Luckily, they were not
needed, and after the memorable storms of 1703 and
1705 the sea so encroached, that the <em>Blockhouse</em> and
Gun Garden, together with the walls and gates, were
sapped, and finally disappeared through stress of
weather.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THERE is nothing particularly noteworthy
with regard to Brighthelmstone until
we come to the embarkation of Charles II.
in July, 1651, from that place for France,
the culmination of his wanderings after
the disastrous Battle of Worcester. There are several
accounts of this event, including one dictated by the King
himself to Samuel Pepys; but the one that is considered
most reliable is Colonel Gounter's narrative, a manuscript
which was found in a secret drawer of an old bureau,
formerly in possession of the Gounter family, and purchased
by a Mr. Bartlett of Havant, when their old
seat at Racton was dismantled about the year 1830.
It is now in the British Museum (Add. MSS., 9,008),
and is entitled, 'The last Act in the Miraculous Storie
of His M<sup>ties</sup> Escape, being a true and perfect relation of
his Conveyance, through many obstacles and after many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
dangers, to a safe harbour out of the reach of his
tyrannical enemies. By Colonell Gounter, of Rackton,
in Sussex, who had the happines to be instrumentall in
the busines (as it was taken from his mouth by a
person of worth, a little before his death).'</p>

<p>The following is the portion relating to Brighthelmstone:</p>

<p>'When we were come to Beeding, a little village
where I had provided a treatment for the King (one
Mr. Bagshall's house), I was earnest that his majesty
should stay there a while till I had viewed the coast;
but my Lord Wilmot would by no means, for fear of
those soldiers, but carried the King out of the road, I
knew not whither; so we parted. They where they
thought safest, I to Brightemston, being agreed they
should send to me when fixed anywhere and ready.</p>

<p>'Being come to the said Brightemston, I found all
clear there, and the inn (the George) free from all
strangers at that time. Having taken the best room
in the house, and bespoke my supper, as I was entertaining
myself with a glass of wine, the King, not finding
accommodation to his mind,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> was come to the inn: and
up comes mine host (one Smith by name). "More
guests," saith he to me. He brought them up into
another room, I taking no notice. It was not long,
but, drawing towards the King's room, I heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
King's voice, saying aloud to my lord Wilmot, "Here,
Mr. Barlow, I drink to you." "I know that name,"
said I to mine host, now by me. "I pray inquire
whether he was not a major in the King's army." Which
done, he was found to be the man whom I expected,
and presently invited (as was likely) to the fellowship
of a glass of wine.</p>

<p>'From that I proceeded, and made a motion to join
company; and, because my chamber was largest, that
they would make use of it, which was accepted, and, so,
we became one company again.</p>

<p>'At supper, the King was cheerful, not shewing the
least sign of fear or apprehension of any danger, neither
then, nor at any time during the whole course of this
business, which is no small wonder, considering that
the very thought of his enemies, so great and so many,
so diligent and so much interested in his ruin, was
enough, as long as he was within their reach; and, as
it were, in the very midst of them, to have daunted the
stoutest courage in the world, as if God had opened his
eyes, as he did Elisha's servant at his master's request,
and he had seen an heavenly host round about him to
guard him, which, to us, was invisible; who, therefore,
though much encouraged by his undauntedness and the
assurance of so good and glorious a cause, yet were not
without secret terrors within ourselves, and thought
every minute, a day, a month, till we should see his
sacred person out of their reach.</p>

<p>'Supper ended, the King stood with his back against
the fire, leaning over a chair. Up came mine host
(upon some jealousy, I guess, not my certain knowledge);
but up comes he, who called himself Gaius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
runs to the King, catcheth his hand, and kissing it,
said, "It shall not be said but I have kissed the best
man's hand in England."</p>

<p>'He had waited at table at supper time, where the
boatman also sat with us, and were there present.
Whether he had seen, or heard anything that could
give him any occasion of suspicion, I know not; in very
deed, the King had a hard task so to carry himself in
all things, that he might be in nothing like himself,
majesty being so natural unto him, that, even when he
said nothing, did nothing, his very looks (if a man
observed) were enough to betray him.</p>

<p>'It was admirable to see how the King (as though
he had not been concerned in these words, which might
have sounded in the ears of another man as the sentence
of death) turned about in silence, without any alteration
of countenance, or taking notice of what had been said.</p>

<p>'About a quarter of an hour after, the King went to
his chamber, where I followed him, craved his pardon
with earnest protestation, that I was as innocent, so
altogether ignorant of the cause how this had happened.
"Peace, peace, colonel," said the King, "the fellow
knows me, and I him; he was one (whether so, or not,
I know not, but so the King thought at the time) that
belonged to the back stairs to my father. I hope he is
an honest fellow."</p>

<p>'After this, I began to treat with the boatman (Tettersfield,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
by name), asking him in what readiness he was.
He answered he could not be off that night, because, for
more security, he had brought his vessel into creek, and
the tide had forsaken it, so that it was on ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is observable, that all the while the business had
been in agitation to this very time, the wind had been
contrary. The King, then opening the window, took
notice that the wind had turned, and told the master
of the ship; whereupon, because of the wind and a
clear night, I offered £10 more to the man to get off
that night; but that could not be: however, we agreed
he should take in his company that night.</p>

<p>'But it was a great business that we had in hand,
and God would have us to know so, both by the difficulties
that offered themselves, and, by his help, he
afforded to remove them.</p>

<p>'When we thought we had agreed, the boatman starts
back, and saith, no, except I would insure the bark.
Argue it we did with him, how unreasonable it was, being
so well paid, etc., but to no purpose, so that I yielded
at last, and £200 was his valuation, which was agreed
upon.</p>

<p>'But then, as though he had been resolved to frustrate
all by unreasonable demands, he required my bond; at
which, moved with much indignation, I began to be as
resolute as he; saying, among other things, there were
more boats to be had besides his; and, if he would not
act, another should, and made as though I would go to
another.</p>

<p>'In this contest, the King happily interposed, "He
saith right," (saith his majesty), "A gentleman's word,
especially before witnesses, is as good as his bond." At
last, the man's stomach came down, and carry them he
would, whatsoever came of it: and, before he would be
taken, he would run his boat under the water: so it
was agreed that about two in the night they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
be aboard. The boatman, in the meantime, went to
provide necessaries, and I persuaded the King to take
some rest; he did, in his clothes, and my Lord Wilmot
with him, till towards two of the night. Then I called
them up, shewing them how the time went by my watch.</p>

<p>'Horses being led by the back way towards the beach,
we came to the boat and found all ready, so I took my
leave, craving his majesty's pardon if anything had
happened through error, not want of will or loyalty;
how willingly I would have waited further, but for my
family (being many) which would want me, and I hoped
his majesty would not, not doubting but in a very little
time he should be where he would.</p>

<p>'My only request to his majesty was, that he would
conceal his instruments; wherein their preservation was
much concerned.</p>

<p>'His majesty promised nobody should know. I
abided there, keeping the horses in readiness in case
anything unexpected had happened.</p>

<p>'At eight of the clock, I saw them on sail, and it was
the afternoon before they went out of sight.</p>

<p>'The wind (oh Providence) held very good till next
morning, to ten of the clock brought them to a place in
Normandy, called Fackham,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> some three miles off Havre
de Grace, Wednesday, Oct. 15.</p>

<p>'They were no sooner landed, but the wind turned,
and a violent storm did arise, insomuch that the boatman
was forced to cut his cable, and lost his anchor to
save his boat, for which he required of me £8, and
had it.'<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>On the King's restoration, Tattersal shared the fate
of most of those who had helped the King in his need;
but he must have either had good interest or was very
pertinacious in his claim, for his coal-brig, ornamented
and enlarged, was taken into the Royal Navy as a fifth-rate,
under the name of the <em>Royal Escape</em>, and on
September 4, 1671, the Duke of York, as Lord High
Admiral, appointed Tattersal to be her captain (a
sinecure post), with pay as such, and an extra pension
of £100 per annum. On August 29, 1672, the King
granted the reversion of this appointment to his son
Nicholas, to take effect after the death of Tattersal
senior, which took place on May 20, 1674. He was
buried near the south side of Brighton Church, under a
marble slab, commemorative of his virtues. The <em>Royal
Escape</em> was for some years moored off Whitehall; afterwards
she was relegated to Deptford, where she gradually
decayed, and was broken up for firewood in 1791.</p>

<p>We get an account of Brighton in 1730 in 'Magna
Britannia' (pp. 510 and 511), which states that it is 'an
indifferent large and populous town, chiefly inhabited
by fishermen, and having a good Market weekly on
Thursday, and a Fair yearly. The Situation is very
pleasant, and generally accounted healthful; for, tho'
it is bounded on the North side by the <em>British Channel</em>,
yet it is encompassed on the other Parts with large
Cornfields and fruitful Hills, which feed great Flocks
of Sheep, bearing Plenty of Wooll, which is thought by
some concern'd in the Woollen Manufacture, to be of
the finest Sort in <em>England</em>.... About 90 Years ago,
this Town was a very considerable Place for Fishing,
and in a flourishing Condition, being, then, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
principal Towns of the County, containing nearly six
hundred Families; but since the Beginning of the Civil
Wars, it hath decay'd much for want of a Free Fishery,
and by very great Losses by Sea, their Shipping being
very often taken from them by the Enemy: Nay, it is
the Opinion of the most judicious Inhabitants that,
had not Divine Providence in a great Measure protected
them by their Town being built low, and standing on a
flat Ground, the <em>French</em> would several Times have quite
demolish'd it, as they had attempted to do; but the
low Situation of it prevented their doing it any considerable
Damage, the Cannon Balls usually flying over
the Town; But the greatest Damage to the Buildings
has been done by the breaking in of the Sea, which,
within these 40 Years, hath laid Waste above 130
Tenements; which Loss, by a modest Computation,
amounts to near £40,000; and, if some speedy Care
be not taken to stop the Encroachments of the Ocean,
it is probable that the Town will, in a few Years, be
utterly depopulated; the Inhabitants being already
diminished one third less than they were, and those
that remain are many of them Widows, Orphans,
decrepid Persons, and all very poor; insomuch that
the Rates for their Relief are at the Rack Rent of 8<sup>d</sup>
in the Pound, for there are but few Charities given for
their Support.'</p>

<p>Groynes, however, were introduced early in the
eighteenth century, with such good effect as to do away
with the above dismal apprehensions. Indeed, it was
beginning to be a place for visitors to come to for the
benefit of the bathing and sea-air, as we may see by the
following letter from the Rev. William Clarke (grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of the celebrated traveller, Edward Daniel Clarke
(1769-1822)), to his friend Mr. Bowyer.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
'<span class="smcap">Brighthelmstone</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
'<i>July 22, 1736</i> &nbsp;.
</p>

<p>'We are now sunning ourselves upon the beach at
Brighthelmstone, and observing what a tempting figure
this Island made formerly in the eyes of those gentlemen
who were pleased to civilize and subdue us. The place
is really pleasant; I have seen nothing in its way that
outdoes it. Such a tract of sea; such regions of corn;
and such an extent of fine carpet, that gives your eye
the command of it all. But then, the mischief is that
we have little conversation besides the <em>clamor nauticus</em>,
which is, here, a sort of treble to the plashing of the
waves against the cliffs. My morning business is
bathing in the sea, and then buying fish; the evening
is riding out for air, viewing the remains of old Saxon
camps, and counting the ships in the road, and the
boats that are trawling.</p>

<p>'Sometimes we give the imagination leave to expatiate
a little; fancy that you are coming down, and that we
intend to dine one day next week at Dieppe in
Normandy; the price is already fixed, and the wine
and lodging there tolerably good. But, though we
build these castles in the air, I assure you we live
here <em>almost under ground</em>. I fancy the architects here
usually take the altitude of the inhabitants, and lose
not an inch between the head and the ceiling, and then
dropping a step or two below the surface: the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
story is finished something under 12 feet. I suppose
this was a necessary precaution against storms, that a
man should not be blown out of his bed into New
England, Barbary, or God knows where.</p>

<p>'But, as the lodgings are <em>low</em>, they are cheap; we
have <em>two parlours</em>, <em>two bed chambers</em>, <em>pantry</em>, <em>etc.</em>, for
5s. per week; and if you will really come down you
need not fear a bed of proper dimensions.</p>

<p>'And, then, the coast is safe; the cannons all covered
with rust and grass; the ships moored, and no enemy
apprehended. Come and see.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Lee tells us that about 1736 the delightful situation
of Brighthelmstone began to attract some visitors of
distinction as early in the summer as the deep miry
Sussex roads were in some way passable. Hunting,
horse-racing, and water-parties were then the chief, or
sole, attractions; and a few indifferent inns their only
places of accommodation.</p>

<p>But Dr. Richard Russell, having removed from
Mailing, near Lewes, to this town about the year
1750, called attention to the benefit of sea-bathing,
having written a treatise, which was translated into
English, and went through several editions&mdash;'De Tabe
Glandulari, sive de usu aquæ marinæ in morbis
glandularum dissertatio,' Oxford, 1750, 8vo. This
brought visitors to Brighthelmstone; the erection of
lodging-houses became a profitable speculation, and
the town began to increase in population and celebrity.</p>

<p>Dr. Russell's successor, Dr. A. Relhan, wrote, in 1761,
'A Short History of Brighthelmston, with Remarks on
its Air, and an Analysis of its Waters, particularly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
an uncommon Mineral one, long discovered, though
but lately used.' In this tract he thus describes the
Brighthelmstone of his time:</p>

<p>'The town, at present, consists of six principal streets,
many lanes, and some spaces surrounded with houses,
called by the inhabitants Squares. The great plenty
of flint stones on the shore, and in the cornfields near
the town, enabled them to build the walls of their
houses with that material when in their most impoverished
state; and their present method of ornamenting
the windows and doors with the admirable brick
which they burn for their own use, has a very pleasing
effect. The town improves daily, as the inhabitants,
encouraged by the late great resort of Company, seem
disposed to expend the whole of what they acquire in
the erection of new buildings, or making the old ones
convenient. And, should the increase of these, in the
next seven years, be equal to what it has been in the
last, it is probable there will be but few towns in
England that will exceed this in commodious buildings.</p>

<p>'Here are two public rooms, the one convenient, the
other not only so, but elegant; not excelled, perhaps,
by any public room in England, that of York excepted:
and the attention of the proprietor in preparing everything
that may answer for the conveniency and amusement
of the company is extremely meritorious.</p>

<p>'The men of this town are busied almost the whole
year in a succeeding variety of fishing; and the women
industriously dedicate part of their time, disengaged
from domestic cares, to the providing of nets adapted
to the various employments of their husbands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>'The spring season is spent in dredging for Oysters,
which are mostly bedded in the Thames and Medway,
and, afterwards, carried to the London market: the
Mackerel fishery employs them during the months of
May, June, and July; and the fruits of their labour are
always sent to London; as Brighthelmston has the
advantage of being its nearest fishing sea coast, and the
consumption of the place, and its environs, is very inconsiderable.
In the early part of this fishery, they
frequently take the red Mullet; and, near the close of
it, abundance of Lobsters and Prawns. August is
engaged in the Trawl fishery, when all sorts of flat
fish are taken in a net called by that name. In
September they fish for Whiting with lines: and in
November the Herring fishery takes place, which is the
most considerable and growing fishery of the whole.
Those employed in this pursuit show an activity and
boldness almost incredible, often venturing out to Sea
in their little boats in such weather as the largest ships
can scarce live in. Part of their acquisition in this way
is sent to London, but the greatest share of it is either
pickled, or dried and made red. These are mostly
sent to foreign markets, making this fishery a national
concern....</p>

<p>'From this account of the fishery of this town, the
reader will be satisfied that it must supply a constant
and good article in provision to the inhabitants. And
although there are complaints made of the inconveniences
experienced in the want of a regular and daily market;
yet, as few who come here to take the waters can long
want an appetite, and as fish of different sorts, excellent
mutton, beef, and veal tolerably good, with all kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of fowl, may be had in plenty twice or thrice a week,
the rarities of a London market may be resigned unregretted
for a few months.'</p>

<p>It is probable that very few towns have so many
variations on their names as Brighton, which modernized
form began somewhere about 1775; at least, that is
the earliest date I have met with. F. E. Sawyer, Esq.,
F.M.S., in an article on the 'Ecclesiastical History of
Brighton' in the 'Sussex Archæological Collections,'
vol. xxix., pp. 182, 183, gives forty-five different
readings of the name, together with the authorities
whence they are derived, and he repeated them in
<cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, vi. S. ii. 376, with the dates of the
authorities. They are as follow:</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/b.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BRIGHTON rapidly became fashionable,
and we find the announcement on June 1,
1761, of Lord Abergavenny, Lord Bruce,
Mr. and Lady Jane Evelyn, Lady Sophia
Egerton, etc.; and on June 25, 1775,
arrived here the Duke and Duchess of Richmond, Duke
and Duchess of Marlborough, Ladies Caroline and Eliza
Spencer, etc. In 1782 it was patronized by Royalty, for
the somewhat eccentric Princess Amelia Sophia Eleonora,
the second daughter of George II., paid the town a visit,
and Henry Frederick, brother to George III. and Duke
of Cumberland, took up his residence there at Grove
House. An extract from a letter from Brighthelmstone
published in the <cite>Morning Herald</cite>, September 28, 1782,
describes the state of society there at that time:</p>

<p>'<i>Sep. 26.</i>&mdash;This place is, at last, as full as an egg,
but the company is a motley groupe, I assure you. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Duke of C&mdash;&mdash; is at the head of the whole, and condescendingly
associates with all, from the <em>Baron</em> down
to the <em>Blackleg</em>!&mdash;<em>Play</em> runs high, particularly at Whist;
his Royal Highness has touched a few hundreds by
betting adverse to Major B&mdash;&mdash;gs, who, apparently, is
not like to make a very profitable campaign of it. We
have every kind of amusement that fancy can desire for
the train of folly and dissipation; and all are crowded
beyond measure! <em>Barthelemon</em> has had two or three
<em>boreish concerts</em> entirely of <em>his own</em> music, by which he
has made much more than he merited. Lady <em>Worsley</em>,
who is among us, is the life and soul of <em>equestrian
parties</em>, riding <em>sixteen miles within the hour</em> every
morning with all imaginable ease! Her Ladyship
made a match the other day to ride over our revived
course for fifty guineas, p. or p. against her aide du
camp, Miss V&mdash;&mdash;rs, and mounted her buckskins and
half boots accordingly; but, to the mortification of a
great number of spectators, who assembled to see this
exhibition of <em>female jockeyship</em>, she declared off at the
moment they were expected to start! Few people
think of stirring from hence at present, so that it is
probable we shall have a jolly season till the staghounds
come down, about the middle of next month.'</p>

<p>This Duke of Cumberland (born 1744, died 1790)
was the reverse of estimable in character. He was a
confirmed gambler, and never missed a great horse-race
when he was in England. In 1770 Lord Grosvenor
brought an action against him, and obtained £10,000
damages from him on account of Lady G.; and in
1771 he married Lady Anne Luttrell, the widow of
Mr. Christopher Horton, of Derbyshire, a lady much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
older than himself. This so enraged George III. that
he forbade them the Court, and he sent a message
to Parliament, recommending a legislative provision
for preventing any of the Royal Family marrying
without the consent of the King. Hence arose The
Royal Marriage Act (12 George III., c. xi.), which
was passed in 1772. By this Act none of the descendants
of George II., unless of foreign birth, can marry
under the age of twenty-five without the consent of the
King. At and after that age, after twelve months'
notice given to the Privy Council, they may contract
such marriage, which shall be good unless both Houses
of Parliament disapprove. Walpole gives us a ballad on
the Marriage Act, a few verses of which I reproduce:</p>

<p>The Duke was ultimately reconciled to the King,
but, during the time of his displeasure, the former was
a very bad Mentor to the young Prince of Wales, with
whom he was most intimate to the day of his death.
We learn a great deal about them from Walpole. The
following occurred in 1780, when the Prince was eighteen
years old:<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> 'Two days afterwards the Duke told me
the Prince of Wales had said to him: "I cannot come
to see you now without the King's leave, but in three
years I shall be of age, and then I may act for myself.
I will declare I will visit you."'</p>

<p>Again<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> (1781): 'But an event soon happened that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
changed that aspect, and made Cumberland House
naturally the headquarters of at least part of the
Opposition. The Duchess of Cumberland and the
Luttrells openly countenanced the amour of the Prince
of Wales, and Mrs. Armstead ... joined that faction,
and set themselves in open defiance of the King.</p>

<p>'The first project was to make a ball for the Prince
at Cumberland House; but the King forbad his servants
going thither. The Duke then made a great dinner
for the Prince's servants, to which, as I have said, the
King would not permit them to go. The Duke was so
enraged, that he wrote a most insolent letter to the
King, in which he told him he would go abroad, for
this country was not fit for a gentleman to live in.
The Duke, however, went to the Drawing-room again,
and continued to go, the Duchess having certainly told
him that if he absented himself he would lose his influence
over the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>'To the Queen's ball, as I have said, the Duke was
not invited, yet went to Court the next day. At that
ball the Prince got drunk, which threw him into a
dangerous fever, but such a general irruption over his
whole face and body of the humours in his blood came
out, that it probably saved his life.</p>

<p>'At this moment the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester
came to town from Weymouth. The King, as usual,
vented his complaints to the Duke of Gloucester. The
King told the Duke that though, on the reconciliation,
he had told the Duke of Cumberland that all his doors
would be opened to him, "yet," said the King, "he
comes to the Queen's house fourteen times a week to
my son, the Prince, and passes by my door, but never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
comes in to me; and, if he meets me there, or when we
are hunting, he only pulls off his hat, and walks, or
rides away. I am ashamed," continued he, "to see my
brother paying court to my son." The King resented
it, and, though he invited the principal persons who
hunted, to dinner, he never invited the Duke of Cumberland.
The Prince of Wales seemed to be very weak
and feeble. He drank hard, swore, and passed every
night in &mdash;&mdash;: such were the fruits of his being locked
up in the palace of piety!</p>

<p>'The King further informed the Duke of Gloucester
of his brother Cumberland's outrageous letter, and said,
"He has forced himself every day into my son's company,
even when he was at the worst." The Duke said
he wondered his Majesty had suffered it. "I don't
know," replied the King, "<em>I do not care to part relations</em>."'</p>

<p>'<i>May 4, 1781.</i><a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;The conduct of the Prince of
Wales began already to make the greatest noise, and
proved how very bad his education had been, or, rather,
that he had had little or none; but had only been
locked up, and suffered to keep company with the
lowest domestics; while the Duke of Montague, and
Hurd, Bishop of Lichfield, had thought of nothing but
paying court to the King and Queen, and her German
women. The Prince drank more publicly in the
Drawing room, and talked there irreligiously and indecently,
in the openest manner (both which were the
style of the Duchess of Cumberland). He passed the
nights in the lowest debaucheries, at the same time
bragging of intrigues with women of quality, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
named publicly. Both the Prince and the Duke talked
of the King in the grossest terms, even in his hearing,
as he told the Duke of Gloucester, who asked him why
he did not forbid his son seeing his brother. The King
replied that he feared the Prince would not obey him.</p>

<p>'The Duke of Cumberland dropped that he meant
by this outrageous behaviour to force the King to yield
to terms in favour of his Duchess, having gotten entire
command over the Prince. The latter, however, had
something of the duplicity of his grandfather, Prince
Frederick, and, after drawing in persons to abuse the
King, would betray them to the King. Nor in other
respects did his heart turn to good. In his letters to
Mrs. Robinson, his mistress, he called his sister, the
Princess Royal, a poor child, "<em>that bandy-legged b&mdash;- h,
my sister</em>;" and, while he was talking of Lord Chesterfield
in the most opprobrious terms, he was sending
courier after courier to fetch him to town. That Lord's
return produced a scene that divulged all that till now
had been only whispered.</p>

<p>'One night, as soon as the King was gone to bed,
the Prince, with St. Leger and Charles Windham, his
chief favourites, and some of his younger servants, the
Duke of Cumberland, and George Pitt, son of Lord
Rivers, went to Blackheath to sup with Lord Chesterfield,
who, being married, would not consent to send for
the company the Prince required. They all got immediately
drunk, and the Prince was forced to lie down on a
bed for some time. On his return, one of the company
proposed as a toast, "<em>A short reign to the King</em>." The
Prince, probably a little come to himself, was offended,
rose and drank a bumper to "<em>Long live the King</em>." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
next exploit was to let loose a large fierce house-dog,
and George Pitt, of remarkable strength, attempted to
tear out its tongue. The dog broke from him, wounded
Windham's arm, and tore a servant's leg. At six in
the morning, when the Prince was to return, Lord
Chesterfield took up a candle to light him, but was so
drunk that he fell down the steps into the area, and, it
was thought, had fractured his skull. That accident
spread the whole history of the debauch, and the King
was so shocked that he fell ill on it, and told the Duke
of Gloucester that he had not slept for ten nights, and
that whenever he fretted, the bile fell on his breast. As
he was not ill on any of the disgraces of the war, he
showed how little he had taken them to heart. Soon
after this adventure, the King being to review a
regiment on Blackheath, Lord Chesterfield offered him
a breakfast, but the late affair had made such a noise
that he did not think it decent to accept it.</p>

<p>'<i>Nov. 28, 1781.</i><a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;The Duke of Gloucester had come
to town, as usual, on the opening of Parliament, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
stayed five days, in which he was three times with
the King, who, as if he had not used the Duke ill,
opened his mind to him on his son, the Prince of Wales,
and his own brother, the Duke of Cumberland, the
latter of whom, he said, was governed by Charles Fox
and Fitzpatrick, and governed the Prince of Wales,
whom they wanted to drive into opposition. "When we
hunt together," said the King, "neither my son nor
my brother speak to me; and, lately, when the chace
ended at a little village where there was but a single
post chaise to be hired, my son and brother got into it,
and drove to London, leaving me to go home in a cart,
if I could find one." He added, that when at Windsor,
where he always dined at three, and in town at four,
if he asked the Prince to dine with him, he always came
at four at Windsor, and in town at five, and all the
servants saw the father waiting an hour for the son.
That since the Court was come to town, the Duke of
Cumberland carried the Prince to the lowest places of
debauchery, where they got dead drunk, and were often
carried home in that condition.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="GEORGE_IV_AS_PRINCE_OF_WALES"></a>
<img src="images/i_036fp.jpg"  alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">GEORGE IV. AS PRINCE OF WALES, 1 FEB. 1782.</div></div>

<p>'<i>Feb. 20, 1782.</i><a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>&mdash;The hostilities of the Prince
of Wales were supposed to be suggested by his uncle,
the Duke of Cumberland, who had now got entire
influence over him. The Prince, though, at first, he
did not go openly to her, frequently supped with the
Duchess of Cumberland; and, in a little time, they
openly kept a faro bank for him&mdash;not to their credit;
and the Duke of Cumberland even carried bankers and
very bad company to the Prince's apartments in the
Queen's house. This behaviour was very grating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
King, and the offences increased. The Duke of Cumberland
twice a day passed by the King's apartment to his
nephew's, without making his bow to his Majesty; and
the brothers, at last, ceased to speak. On hunting-days
the Duke was not asked to dine with the King.
He returned this by instilling neglect into his nephew.
The King complained of this treatment to the Duke of
Gloucester, who asked why he bore it. "What can I
do?" said the King; "if I resent it, they will make my
son leave me, and break out, which is what they wish."</p>

<p>'But it was not long before the folly and vulgarity of
the Duke of Cumberland disgusted the Prince. His
style was so low that, alluding to the Principality
of Wales, the Duke called his nephew <em>Taffy</em>. The
Prince was offended at such indecent familiarity, and
begged it might not be repeated&mdash;but in vain. Soon
after, Mr. Legge, one of the Prince's gentlemen, and
second son of the Earl of Dartmouth, growing a
favourite, inflamed the Prince's disgusts; and the coolness
increasing, the Duke of Cumberland endeavoured
to counteract the prejudice by calling Legge to the
Prince "Your <em>Governor</em>"&mdash;but as the Governor had
sense, and the uncle none, Legge's arrows took place, the
others did not. Yet, though the Prince had too much
pride to be treated vulgarly, he had not enough to
disuse the same style. Nothing was coarser than his
conversation and phrases; and it made men smile to find
that in the palace of piety and pride his Royal Highness
had learned nothing but the dialect of footmen and
grooms. Still, if he tormented his father, the latter
had the comfort of finding that, with so depraved and
licentious a life, his son was not likely to acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
popularity. Nor did he give symptoms of parts, or
spirit, or steadiness. A tender parent would have been
afflicted&mdash;a jealous and hypocritic father might be
vexed, but was consoled too.'</p>

<p>One more quotation from Walpole,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which shows us
the Prince of Wales after he had attained his eighteenth
year, when he had his own suite of apartments in the
Queen's House (now Buckingham Palace):</p>

<p>'<i>Feb., 1781.</i>&mdash;A new scene now began to open,
which drew most of the attention of the public, at least
of the town. Since the family of the Prince of Wales
had been established, and that he was now past eighteen,
it was impossible to confine him entirely. As soon as
the King went to bed, the Prince and his brother Prince
Frederick went to their mistresses, or to &mdash;&mdash;. Prince
Frederick, who promised to have the most parts, and
had an ascendant over his brother, was sent abroad on
that account, and thereby had an opportunity of seeing
the world, which would only make him more fit to
govern his brother (contrary to the views of both King
and Queen) or the nation, if his brother should fail,
and which was not improbable.</p>

<p>'The Prince of Wales was deeply affected with the
scrofulous humour which the Princess of Wales had
brought into the blood, and which the King kept
down in himself by the most rigorous and systematical
abstinence. The Prince, on the contrary, locked up in
the palace, and restrained from the society of women,
had contracted a habit of private drinking, and this
winter the humour showed itself in blotches all over his
face. His governor, the Duke of Montague, was utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
incapable of giving him any kind of instruction, and his
preceptor, Bishop Hurd, was only a servile pedant,
ignorant of mankind. The Prince was good-natured,
but so uninformed that he often said, "I wish anybody
would tell me what to do; nobody gives me any instructions
for my conduct." He was prejudiced against
all his new servants, as spies set on him by the King,
and showed it by never speaking to them in public.
His first favourite had been Lord Malden, son of the
Earl of Essex, who had brought about his acquaintance
with Mrs. Robinson.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinson&mdash;Her story of Florizel and Perdita&mdash;Her after-career&mdash;Coming

Hanger's adventure.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w044.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">WHO was this Mrs. Robinson? She was of
Irish extraction, and was born in Bristol
in 1758. In 1774 she married an
attorney's clerk, named Robinson; and,
owing to pecuniary difficulties, she went
on the stage, appearing at Drury Lane as Juliet on
December 10, 1770, a part for which her fascinating
beauty well fitted her. On December 3, 1779, Garrick's
adaptation of Shakespeare's <em>Winter's Tale</em> was produced
by royal command, and Mrs. Robinson appeared in the
part of Perdita. It was then that she was seen and
admired by the Prince of Wales. Let her tell her own
story as to that night, and what came of it.</p>

<p>'The play of the Winter's Tale was, this season,
commanded by their Majesties. I never had performed
before the royal family; and the first character in which
I was destined to appear was that of Perdita. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
frequently played the part, both with the Hermione of
Mrs. Hartley and of Miss Farren: but I felt a strange
degree of alarm when I found my name announced to
perform it before the royal family.</p>

<p>'In the green-room I was rallied on the occasion;
and Mr. Smith, whose gentlemanly manners and enlightened
conversation rendered him an ornament to
the profession, who performed the part of Leontes,
laughingly exclaimed, "By Jove, Mrs. Robinson, you
will make a conquest of the Prince; for to-night you
look handsomer than ever." I smiled at the unmerited
compliment, and little foresaw the vast variety of events
that would arise from that night's exhibition!</p>

<p>'As I stood in the wing opposite the Prince's box,
waiting to go on the stage, Mr. Ford, the manager's
son, and now a respectable defender of the laws, presented
a friend who accompanied him; this friend was
Lord Viscount Malden, now Earl of Essex.</p>

<p>'We entered into conversation during a few minutes,
the Prince of Wales all the time observing us, and
frequently speaking to Colonel (now General) Lake,
and to the Honourable Mr. Legge, brother to Lord
Lewisham, who was in waiting on his Royal Highness.
I hurried through the first scene, not without much
embarrassment, owing to the fixed attention with which
the Prince of Wales honoured me. Indeed, some flattering
remarks which were made by his Royal Highness
met my ear as I stood near his box, and I was overwhelmed
with confusion.</p>

<p>'The Prince's particular attention was observed by
everyone, and I was again rallied at the end of the
play. On the last curtsey, the royal family con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>descendingly
returned a bow to the performers; but,
just as the curtain was falling, my eyes met those of
the Prince of Wales; and with a look that I <em>never shall
forget</em>, he gently inclined his head a second time; I felt
the compliment, and blushed my gratitude.</p>

<p>'During the entertainment Lord Malden never
ceased conversing with me: he was young, pleasing,
and perfectly accomplished. He remarked the particular
applause which the Prince had bestowed on my performance;
said a thousand civil things; and detained
me in conversation till the evening's performance was
concluded.</p>

<p>'I was now going to my chair, which waited, when I
met the royal family crossing the stage. I was again
honoured with a very marked and low bow from the
Prince of Wales. On my return home, I had a party
to supper; and the whole conversation centred in
encomiums on the person, graces, and amiable manners
of the illustrious Heir apparent.</p>

<p>'Within two or three days of this time, Lord Malden
made me a morning visit. Mr. Robinson was not at
home, and I received him rather awkwardly. But his
Lordship's embarrassment far exceeded mine. He
attempted to speak,&mdash;paused, hesitated, apologized; I
knew not why. He hoped I would pardon him; that
I would not mention something he had to communicate;
that I would consider the peculiar delicacy of his situation,
and then act as I thought proper. I could not
comprehend his meaning, and therefore requested he
would be explicit.</p>

<p>'After some moments of evident rumination, he
tremblingly drew a small letter from his pocket. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
took it, and knew not what to say. It was addressed
to <span class="smcap">Perdita</span>. I smiled, I believe, rather sarcastically,
and opened the billet. It contained only a few words,
but those expressive of more than common civility:
they were signed <span class="smcap">Florizel</span>.</p>

<p>'"Well, my lord, and what does this mean?" said I,
half angrily.</p>

<p>'"Can you not guess the writer?" said Lord Malden.</p>

<p>'"Perhaps yourself, my lord," cried I, gravely.</p>

<p>'"Upon my honour, no," said the Viscount. "I
should not have dared so to address you on so short
an acquaintance."</p>

<p>'I pressed him to tell me from whom the letter came.
He again hesitated; he seemed confused, and sorry that
he had undertaken to deliver it.</p>

<p>'"I hope I shall not forfeit your good opinion," said
he; "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"But what, my lord?"</p>

<p>'"I could not refuse&mdash;for the letter is from the
Prince of Wales."</p>

<p>'I was astonished; I confess that I was agitated; but
I was, also, somewhat sceptical as to the truth of Lord
Malden's assertion. I returned a formal and a doubtful
answer, and his lordship shortly after took his leave.'</p>

<p>It is not worth while pursuing the details of this
woman's fall; she says her husband was neglectful of
her, and unfaithful; and, besides, the Prince gave her a
bond for £20,000, payable when he came of age. He
soon tired of her, and terminated the connection in
1781. The lady seems to have been far from inconsolable,
for in 1782 she was under the protection
of Colonel Tarleton, and a caricature, said to be by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Gillray, called 'The Thunderer' (August 20, 1782),
thus shows the then situation.</p>

<p>The engraving shows a dragoon officer (Colonel
Tarleton) standing before the door of the 'Whirligig'
Chop-house, with a drawn sword, boasting his wondrous
feats of arms. Beside him stands a figure having a
plume of three feathers instead of a head (the Prince
of Wales). The sign, the 'Whirligig,' is Mrs. Robinson.
The <cite>Morning Post</cite>, September 21, 1782, says: 'Yesterday,
a messenger arrived in town, with the very interesting
and pleasing intelligence of the Tarleton, armed ship,
having, after a chace of some months, captured the
Perdita frigate, and brought her safe into Egham port.
The Perdita is a prodigious fine clean bottomed vessel,
and had taken many prizes during her cruize, particularly
the Florizel, a most valuable ship belonging
to the Crown, but which was immediately released, after
taking out the cargo. The Perdita was captured some
time ago by the Fox, but was, afterwards, retaken by
the Malden, and had a sumptuous suit of new rigging,
when she fell in with the Tarleton. Her manœuvring
to escape was admirable; but the Tarleton, fully determined
to take her, or perish, would not give up the
chace; and at length, coming alongside the Perdita,
fully determined to board her, sword in hand, she
instantly surrendered at discretion.'</p>

<p>The scandal about her being connected with Fox
has, I think, no foundation in fact. He was infatuated
with Mrs. Armstead, who afterwards became his wife;
and the foundation for the rumour was, probably, that
Fox was the agent from the Prince to negotiate the
return of the £20,000 bond from Perdita, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
succeeded in effecting, on condition that she was paid
an annuity of £500 for life. Still, the caricaturist
T. Colley gives us (December 17, 1782), 'Perdito and
Perdita, or the Man and Woman of the People,' which
shows Mrs. Robinson driving Fox in her chariot. This
must have been a very smart affair, if we may trust a
newspaper cutting of 1782.</p>

<p>'<i>Dec. 4.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Robinson now sports a carriage,
which is the admiration of all the <em>charioteering</em> circles
in the vicinity of St. James's; the body Carmelite and
silver, ornamented with a French mantle, and the cypher
in a wreath of flowers: the carriage scarlet and silver,
the seat-cloth richly ornamented with silver fringe.
Mrs. Robinson's livery is green, faced with yellow, and
richly trimmed with broad silver lace; the harness
ornamented with stars of silver, richly chased and
elegantly finished. The inside of the carriage is lined
with white silk, embellished with scarlet trimmings.'</p>

<p>The <cite>Morning Herald</cite>, June 16, 1783, says: 'The
<em>Perdita's</em> new <em>vis-a-vis</em> is said to be the aggregate of a
few stakes laid at Brooke's, which the competitors were
not able to decide. Mr. <em>Fox</em> therefore proposed that
as it could not be better applied than to the above
purpose, that the <em>Perdita</em> should be presented with an
elegant carriage. The ill-natured call it <em>Love's Last
Stake</em>, or The Fools of Fashion.'</p>

<p>It is not worth while following her career until her
death on December 26, 1800; and, indeed, unconnected
as she was with the Prince and Brighton, the episode
would not have been introduced were it not to tell the
story of how the Prince got the name of Florizel, which
stuck to him all his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince came of age on August 12, 1783, but
there were no great festivities over the event. The
Court was quiet, because the Queen had just been confined,
and the account we have of the doings at Windsor
are very meagre. The <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> of August 14
tells us that&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Windsor, 13 Aug.</i>&mdash;Yesterday, being the day on
which his Royal Highness George, Prince of Wales,
came of age, the same was observed, at this place, with
every demonstration of joy, as far as could be consistent
with the situation of Her Majesty. The Prince came
down about eight in the morning, waited upon the
King, with whom he breakfasted, and received the
compliments from his brothers and sisters, the Duke
of Cumberland, Duke of Montague, Lord Aylesbury, etc.
After breakfast, his Highness retired to his own apartments,
and, at noon, had a Levee; Colonel Dalrymple,
with all the officers belonging to the regiment, were
introduced to the Prince, and gave him joy of the day.
Several of the nobility and gentry around the country
waited upon his Royal Highness, and were very politely
received.</p>

<p>'The Prince had ordered a dinner for his own suite,
from Clode's, at the White Hart, and had a turtle
dressed in London, which was brought down by Weltje,
of St. James's Street. His Royal Highness dined with
his Majesty, three of his brothers, five of his sisters, the
Duke of Montague, Lord Aylesbury, and Lady Charlotte
Finch. After the cloth was removed, and a few glasses
had gone round, the Prince went to his own apartments,
and sat for some time with Lord Southampton, Lord
Lewisham, Lord Boston, Lord Chewton and the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
his suite. His Majesty went upon the Terrace at half
past six; the Prince of Wales and his attendants soon
followed. It is said, more genteel company scarce ever
met on that spot.</p>

<p>'The Duchess of Ancaster, Lady Ferrers, the beautiful
Miss Hudson, and a variety of women of rank, did honour
to the day. It was quite dark before the company retired
from the Terrace. The Duke of Queensbury joined his
Royal Highness and his suite. The carriages were so
numerous that they filled both Castle Yards.'</p>

<p>There were illuminations at Windsor and in London,
where His Royal Highness's tradesmen and the Hon.
Artillery Company (of which he was Captain-General)
held good cheer; but it was felt that the coming of age
had not been celebrated in a sufficiently national style,
and a fête later on was talked of, which never came to
pass. Perhaps the Prince's character had something to
do with it, for the <cite>Morning Herald</cite> of August 15 says:
'The broad faced dissipation of a certain young gentleman,
gives the most general disgust. Extravagance in
the <em>extreme</em>, but ill suits the present state of the British
empire.' They were outspoken in those days!</p>

<p>The Prince is now launched in life. He is Colonel
of the 10th Light Dragoons, has £50,000 per annum
allowed him by Parliament, and the revenues of the
Duchy of Cornwall, about £13,000 more. He has
Carlton House fitting up for him; he is his own master,
being no longer under paternal control, and his soul
yearns towards his <i lang="fr">âme damnée</i>, the Duke of Cumberland.
This Prince was at Brighthelmstone, and thither
Florizel went. Every authority but one says that the
Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Duke in 1782; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
I think that the one which has not slavishly copied from
other sources is right, for two reasons: first, that in 1782
he was under strict paternal control, and could stir
nowhere without his governor, and a visit to that uncle
whom the King so disliked was the last thing to be
thought of; and, secondly, we see (on p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>) in the
description of Brighton in 1782, 'The Duke of C. is
at the head of the whole.' If the heir to the throne
had been there, the Duke would have taken 'a back
seat,' and the papers would have given due prominence
to the visit; and therefore I incline to the opinion
that, since the days of his childhood, his first visit to
the watering-place he afterwards made so famous was
in September, 1783, on which occasion the town was
illuminated and there was a display of fireworks. During
his stay of eleven days, he hunted, went to a ball, and
to the theatre, besides the ordinary amusements of the
place. In fact, his visit seems so to have impressed
him, that from that date he made Brighthelmstone his
abiding-place for, at least, a portion of the year. Huish,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
however, gives another version for his liking for the place:</p>

<p>'The Prince had now begun to manifest that predilection
for Brighton, which induced him at a future period
to make that town his residence. The report, however,
which was current at the time, and which is actually
founded on truth, goes so far as to state, that it was
neither the marine views, nor the benefit of change of
air, nor the salubrity of the place, which possessed, in
the eyes of his Royal Highness, at this time, any great
attractions; but that he was drawn thither by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
angelic figure of a sea nymph, whom he, one day, encountered
reclining on one of the groins on the beach.
In this amour, however, his Royal Highness was completely
the dupe. As far as personal charms extended,
Charlotte Fortescue was of "the first order of fine
forms"; but, as far as mental qualifications were to
be considered, she was one of the most illiterate and
ignorant of human beings. In artifice and intrigue she
was unparalleled; and, withal, she knew how to throw
such an air of simplicity and innocence over her actions,
as would have deceived even a greater adept than his
Royal Highness, in the real nature of her character.
She soon discovered the exalted station of the individual
whom she believed she had captivated by her charms;
and, on the principle that the thing is of little value
which is cheaply or easily obtained, she, for a time,
frustrated every attempt of his Royal Highness to
obtain a private interview with her. She kept her
residence a complete secret, and, for some days, she was
neither seen nor heard of. On a sudden, she would
make her appearance, and then, suffused in tears, would
speak of her approaching marriage, and her consequent
departure from the country; and could that idea be
borne by her royal lover? Heaven and earth were to
be moved to avert such a direful calamity; a regular
elopement was proposed, and, in order to give the affair
a highly romantic air, it was arranged that the dress
of a footman was to be procured for the beautiful
fugitive, and that the Prince was to have a postchaise
in waiting a few miles on the London road, to bear
away his valuable prize. There is, however, an old
adage which says, that much falls between the cup and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the lip, and, in this instance, the truth of it was fully
confirmed. The hour was anxiously looked for which
was to bring the lovers into the undisturbed society of
each other; but, as the Prince was dressing for dinner,
the arrival of George Hanger, who had just then begun
his career of eccentricity and profligacy in the fashionable
circles, was announced. The Prince invited him
to dine; excusing himself, however, at the same time,
for the early hour at which he would be obliged to
leave him, as he had most important business to transact
that night in the metropolis. Dinner being over, the
Prince inquired the business which had brought his
visitor to Brighton in so unexpected a manner.</p>

<p>'"A hunt, a hunt, your Royal Highness," said
Hanger, "I am in chace of a d&mdash;&mdash;d fine girl, whom I
met with at Mrs. Simpson's in Duke's Place; and,
although I have taken private apartments for her in
St. Anne's East, yet the hussy takes it into her head
every now and then to absent herself for a few days;
and I have now been given to understand that she is
carrying on some intrigue with a <em>fellow</em> in this place.
Let me but catch him, and I will souse him over head
and ears in the ocean."</p>

<p>'The Prince now inquired what kind of a lady he
was in pursuit of; and, by the description given, he
doubted not for a moment, that the lady with whom
he was to elope that very evening, on account of her
approaching marriage, was the identical lady who had
eloped from the protection of his visitor, and he began
to consider how he could extricate himself with the
best possible grace from the dilemma in which he was
involved. That he was a dupe to the artifices of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
cunning, designing girl, was now apparent to him; and,
therefore, it would be his greatest pride and joy to
outwit her. He, therefore, disclosed the whole of his
intrigue with the runaway, and it was resolved that
Hanger should put on one of the coats in which she
was accustomed to see her royal lover, and take his seat
in the chaise, instead of the Prince. The whole affair
was well managed; the Prince remained at Brighton;
Hanger bore off his lady to London, not a little
chagrined at such an unexpected termination of her
romantic elopement; but not many months elapsed
before the lady gained an opportunity of repaying the
Prince tenfold for the trick which he had played her.'</p>

<p>Memoir of, and anecdotes about, George Hanger.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/h.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE HON. GEORGE HANGER (afterwards
the fourth and last Lord Coleraine)
was at one time an especial friend
of the Prince. He was educated at
Eton and Göttingen, and was for some
little time an officer in the first regiment of foot
guards, which regiment he soon left in disgust at
someone being promoted over his head. He then
received an appointment from the Landgrave of Hesse
Cassel as Captain in the Hessian Jäger Corps, then
serving in America, and he was with this corps
throughout the war. He, afterwards (in 1782), was
made a Major in Tarleton's Light Dragoons, which was
disbanded the following year, and he retired on half-pay.
It was then that he joined the Prince's set, and
received the appointment of equerry at a salary of
£300 per annum, and this, combined with raising
recruits for the East India Company, enabled him for
a time to vie with the jovial crew with which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
associated. But evil days fell upon him, and he dwelt
in the King's Bench Prison from June 2, 1798, to
April, 1799, and in 1800 set up for a time as a coal-merchant,
and was nicknamed the Knight of the Black
Diamond. He appears in many of Gillray's caricatures,
but the most savage pictorial satire on him (by Cruickshank)
was issued with the <em>Scourge</em> for November 2,
1812, where he is represented as a tall, full-faced man,
wearing a long drab-coloured coat with a cape, and a
star upon his right breast. Each of his arms encircles
a gin-drinking old woman, and at his feet, one of which
is cloven like a satyr's, sprawls a young woman who
applies a bottle to her lips. A dandy, standing near,
inspects the scene through his quizzing glass, and
observes: 'Hang her! She's quite drunk.' A label
issuing from the mouth of the principal person makes
him observe: 'As for me, my name is sufficient; I am
known by the title of the Paragon of Debauchery, and
I only claim to be the [Prince]s <em>Confidential Friend</em>.'
The letterpress description of the caricature contains
the following illustrative paragraph:</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="GEORGEY_IN_THE_COAL-HOLE"></a>
<img src="images/i_053fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">GEORGEY IN THE COAL-HOLE.</div>
</div>

<p>'A tall, strapping-looking person, shabbily, but
buckishly attired, with a peculiar cast of countenance,
now stepped forward, and cried out, "My <em>name</em> is
sufficient. Whoever has heard of &mdash;&mdash; must know that
I am without a rival in the annals of debauchery.
I claim no higher honour than to be my <em>Prince's
friend</em>."'</p>

<p>On the death of his brother, on December 11, 1814,
he succeeded to the title of Lord Coleraine, but he
never assumed the title, and disliked being addressed
by it. On his death, unmarried, on March 31, 1824,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
at the age of seventy-three, the barony of Coleraine
became extinct.</p>

<p>Huish tells several stories about Hanger.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> 'It is
well known that the above-mentioned person was the
particular companion of his late Majesty, when Prince
of Wales, and many of the youthful improprieties which
he committed were ascribed, by the King, to the company
which he kept; and, particularly, to the society
of Sheridan and Major Hanger. On a particular occasion,
when the latter was raising recruits, the King,
hearing that the Prince was taken from place to place,
by him and others in high life, collecting mobs, and
throwing money to them in large quantities, for the
sake of creating the fun of seeing a scramble, and other
worse purposes, he, with much feeling, exclaimed, "D&mdash;n
Sherry, and I must hang&mdash;hang&mdash;Hanger, for they will
break my heart, and ruin the hopes of my country."'</p>

<p>The following will be read as a rich treat to the
lovers of fun and mischief: it shows the extraordinary
gaiety of the Prince of Wales's disposition, and the
familiar manner in which he lived with his companions:</p>

<p>It was at the celebration of her Majesty's birthday,
1782, that Major Hanger made his first appearance at
Court; and it may be said to have been a début which
proved a source of infinite amusement to all who were
present, and to no one more so than the Prince of
Wales, who was no stranger to the singularity of his
character, and the general eccentricity of his actions.
Being a Major in the Hessian service, he wore his
uniform at the ball, which was a short blue coat with
gold frogs, with a belt, unusually broad, across his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
shoulders, from which his sword depended. This dress,
being a little particular, when compared with the full-trimmed
suits of velvet and satin about him, though,
as professional, strictly conformable to the etiquette of
the Court, attracted the notice of his Majesty and his
attendants; and the buzz, 'Who is he?' 'Whence
does he come?' etc., etc., was heard in all parts of the
room. Thus he became the focus of attraction, and
especially when the contrast presented itself of his
selecting the beautiful Miss Gunning as his partner.
He led her out to dance a minuet, but when, on the
first crossing of his lovely partner, he put on his hat,
which was of the largest Kevenhüller kind, ornamented
with two large black and white feathers, the figure
which he cut was so truly ridiculous and preposterous,
that even the gravity of his Majesty could not be
restrained: the grave faces of the Ministers relaxed into
a smile, and the Prince of Wales was actually thrown
into a convulsive fit of laughter. There was such an
irresistible provocation to risibility in the <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>
of his appearance and style of movement, that his fair
partner was reluctantly obliged to lose sight of good
manners, and could scarcely finish the minuet; but
Hanger himself joined in the laugh which was raised at
his expense, and thereby extricated his partner from
her embarrassment. This is, perhaps, the first time
that the <i lang="fr">pas grave</i> of a minuet has been considered as a
mighty good jest, but there are moments when even the
most serious circumstances serve only to produce a
comic effect.</p>

<p>The Major now stood up to dance a country dance,
but here his motions were so completely antic, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
much resembling those of a mountebank, that he totally
discomfited his partner, put the whole set into confusion,
and excited a degree of laughter throughout the room
such as had never before been witnessed in a royal
drawing-room.</p>

<p>On the following day the subject of the Major's
ludicrous début at Court became the topic of conversation
at the convivial board at Carlton House, when the
Prince proposed that a letter should be written to the
Major, thanking him in the name of the company which
had assembled in the drawing-room, for the pleasure
and gratification which he had afforded them. The joke
was considered a good one. Writing materials were
ordered, and the Prince himself indited the following
letter, which was copied by Sheridan, with whose handwriting
the Major was unacquainted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
'<span class="smcap">St. James's Street</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
'<em>Sunday morning</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>'The Company who attended the Ball on Friday
last, at S<sup>t</sup> James's, present their compliments to Major
Hanger, and return their unfeigned thanks for the
variety with which he enlivened the insipidity of that
evening's entertainment. The <em>gentlemen</em> want words to
describe their admiration of the truly grotesque and
humourous figure which he exhibited: and the <em>ladies</em>
beg leave to express their acknowledgements for the
lively and animated emotions that his stately, erect,
and perpendicular form could not fail to excite in their
delicate and susceptible bosoms. His gesticulations and
martial deportment were truly admirable, and have
raised an impression that will not be soon effaced at
S<sup>t</sup> James's.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter produced a highly humorous scene, which
often excited a laugh when the Prince related it to his
guests, as one of the most humorous which had occurred
to him during his life.</p>

<p>On the day subsequent to the receipt of this letter,
the Prince purposely invited George Hanger to dine at
Carlton House, and it formed part of the plot of his
Royal Highness, that Sheridan should not be invited.
After dinner the conversation turned, designedly, upon
the leading circumstances of the late ball; and, on the
Prince ironically complimenting the Major on the
serious effect which his appearance must have had on
the hearts of the ladies, he, in a very indignant manner,
drew from his pocket the letter which he had received,
declaring that it was a complete affront upon him, and
that the sole motive of the writer was to insult him,
and turn him into ridicule. The Prince requested permission
to read the letter, and, having perused it, he
fully coincided in the opinion of the Major, that no
other motive could have actuated the writer than to
offer him the greatest affront.</p>

<p>The Major's anger rose. 'Blitz und Hölle!' he
exclaimed; 'if I could discover the writer he should
give me immediate satisfaction.'</p>

<p>'I admire your spirit,' said the Prince; 'how insulting
to talk of your grotesque figure.'</p>

<p>'And then to turn your stately, erect and perpendicular
form into ridicule,' said Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>'And to talk of your gesticulations,' said Captain
Morris.</p>

<p>'Sapperment!' exclaimed the Major, 'but the writer
shall be discovered.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>'Have you not the slightest knowledge of the handwriting?'
asked the Prince; 'the characters are, I
think, somewhat familiar to me. Allow me to peruse
the letter again.' The letter was handed to the Prince.
'I am certain that I am not mistaken,' he said; 'this
is the handwriting of that mischievous fellow, Sheridan.'</p>

<p>'Sheridan!' exclaimed the Major. 'Impossible&mdash;it
cannot be!'</p>

<p>'Hand the letter to Fox,' said the Prince; 'he knows
Sheridan's handwriting well.'</p>

<p>'This is undoubtedly the handwriting of Sheridan,'
said Fox, looking at the letter.</p>

<p>'Then he shall give me immediate satisfaction,' said
the Major, rising from the table; and, addressing himself
to Captain Morris, requested him to be the bearer
of his message to Mr. Sheridan. Having written the
note, in which a full and public apology was demanded,
or a place of meeting appointed, Captain Morris was
despatched with it; and in the meantime he (the Major)
would retire to his lodgings to await the answer from
Mr. Sheridan. The Prince now pretended to interfere,
expressing his readiness to be a mediator between the
parties, but at the same time he contrived, every now
and then, to increase the flame of the Major's resentment
by some artful insinuations as to the grossness of
the affront, and complimenting him on the spirited
manner in which he had behaved on the occasion. The
Major was determined not to be appeased, and he left
the room, muttering, 'D&mdash;n the impudent fellow!
grotesque figure! perpendicular form! gesticulations!'</p>

<p>The Major had no sooner retired than the whole
party burst into a loud laugh. The Prince had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
him to the very point he wished, and in about an hour
Captain Morris arrived with Sheridan, who entered immediately
into the spirit of the adventure. It was
then agreed that Sheridan should accept the challenge,
appointing the following morning at daybreak in Battersea
Fields, and that Mr. Fox should be the bearer of
Mr. Sheridan's answer to the offended Major, Mr.
Sheridan undertaking, on his part, to provide the
necessary surgical assistance.</p>

<p>On the following morning the parties were punctually
on the spot; the Major, accompanied by Captain Morris,
Mr. Sheridan by Mr. Fox, the Prince of Wales, disguised
as a surgeon, being seated in the carriage which conveyed
the latter gentlemen. The customary preliminaries
being arranged, the parties took their
stations. The signal to fire was given; no effect took
place. The seconds loaded the pistols a second time;
the parties fired again; still no effect was produced.</p>

<p>'D&mdash;n the fellow!' said the Major to his second, 'I
can't hit him.'</p>

<p>'The third fire generally takes effect,' said Captain
Morris, who with the utmost difficulty could keep his
risible faculties in order, whilst the Prince, in the
carriage, was almost convulsed with laughter at the
grotesque motions of the Major.</p>

<p>The signal to fire was given the third time. The effect
was decisive; Mr. Sheridan fell, as if dead, on his back.</p>

<p>'Killed, by G&mdash;d!' said Captain Morris. 'Let us
fly instantly;' and, without giving the Major time to
collect himself, he hurried him to the carriage, which
immediately drove away towards town. The Prince
descended from the carriage, almost faint with laughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and joined Sheridan and Fox, the former of whom, as
soon as the Major's carriage was out of sight, had risen
from his prostrate position, unscathed as when he
entered the field, for, to complete the farce, it had
been previously arranged that no balls should be put
into the pistols, and that Sheridan was to fall on the
third fire. The Prince, with his two associates, immediately
drove off to town, and a message was sent
to Major Hanger, desiring his immediate attendance at
Carlton House. The Major obeyed the summons, and
he entered the apartment of the Prince with a most
dolorous countenance.</p>

<p>'Bad business this,' said the Prince&mdash;'a very bad
business, Hanger; but I have the satisfaction to tell
you that Sheridan is not materially hurt, and if you
will dine with me this day, I will invite a gentleman
who will give you an exact account of the state in
which your late antagonist lies. Remain here till
dinner-time, and all may yet be well.'</p>

<p>The Prince, from goodness of heart, and not wishing
that the Major should have the painful impression on
his mind that he had been the instrument of the death
of a fellow-creature and one of the most convivial of
their companions, had imparted to the Major the
consolatory information that his antagonist was not
seriously injured, and the Major looked forward to the
hour of dinner with some anxiety, when he was to
receive further information on the subject. The hour
came. The party was assembled in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>'Now, Hanger,' said the Prince, 'I'll introduce a
gentleman to you who shall give you all the information
you can wish.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened, and Sheridan entered. The Major
started back in wonder.</p>

<p>'How&mdash;how&mdash;how is this?' he stammered. 'I
thought I had killed you.'</p>

<p>'Not quite, my good fellow,' said Sheridan, offering
the Major his hand. 'I am not yet quite good enough
to go to the world above; and, as to that below, I am
not yet fully qualified for it, therefore I considered it
better to defer my departure from this to a future
period; and, now, I doubt not, that his Royal Highness
will give you an explicit explanation of the whole
business&mdash;but I died well, did I not, Hanger?'</p>

<p>The Prince now declared that the whole plot was
concocted by himself, and hoped that when the Major
next fought such a duel, he might be in a coach to
view it. Conviviality reigned throughout the evening;
the song and glass went round; the Prince singing the
parody on 'There's a difference between a beggar and
a queen,' which was composed by Captain Morris, and
which is to be found in the twenty-fourth edition of
'Songs Political and Convivial,' by that first of lyric
poets.</p>

<p>One more anecdote of the Prince and George Hanger,
from the same source,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and I have done with him.</p>

<p>'That the immense losses which the Prince of Wales
sustained at the gaming table were not, always, the
consequence of a run of ill luck, may be easily conjectured.
Scheme after scheme was devised by which
a heavy drain was to be made upon his finances; and
he became, eventually, the dupe of a set of titled
sharpers, who fattened on his credulity, and who, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
acts of the most deliberate villainy, reduced him to a
state of comparative pauperism. As a proof of the
inventive spirit of these associates of the Prince, we
have only to mention the celebrated wager between the
turkeys and the geese, which emanated from the prolific
head of George Hanger, and on the issue of which the
Prince found himself minus several thousand pounds.</p>

<p>'During one of the convivial parties at Carlton House,
George Hanger designedly introduced the subject of the
travelling qualifications of the turkey and the goose,
and he pronounced it as his opinion (although directly
contrary to his real one), that the turkey would outstrip
the goose. The Prince, who placed great reliance on
the judgment of George Hanger on subjects of that
nature, backed Hanger's opinion; and, as it may be
supposed, there were some of the party who were willing
to espouse the part of the goose: the dispute ended in
the Prince making a match of twenty turkeys against
twenty geese for a distance of ten miles, the competitors
to start at four o'clock in the afternoon. The race was
to be run for £500; and, as George Hanger and the
turkey party hesitated not to lay two to one in favour
of their bird, the Prince did the same to a considerable
amount, not in the least suspecting that the whole was
a deep laid plan to extract a sum of money from his
pockets, for his chance of winning, from the natural
propensity of the turkey, was wholly out of the question.</p>

<p>'The Prince took great interest in this extraordinary
wager, and deputed George Hanger to select twenty of
the most wholesome and high feathered birds which
could be procured; and, on the day appointed, the
Prince and his party of turkeys and Mr. Berkeley and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
his party of geese, set off to decide the match. For the
first three hours everything seemed to indicate that the
turkeys would be the winners, as they were, then, two
miles in advance of the geese; but, as night came on,
the turkeys began to stretch out their necks towards the
branches of the trees which lined the sides of the road.
In vain the Prince attempted to urge them on with his
pole, to which a bit of red cloth was attached: in vain
George Hanger dislodged one from its roosting-place,
before he saw three or four others comfortably perching
among the branches&mdash;in vain was barley strewn upon
the road; no art, no stratagem, no compulsion, could
prevent them taking to their roosting-place! whilst, in
the meantime, the geese came waddling on, and in a
short time passed the turkey party, who were all busy
in the trees, dislodging their obstinate birds; but, as
to further progress, it was found impossible, and the
geese were declared the winners.</p>

<p>'Trifling as this circumstance may appear, it will have
the tendency of exposing the characters of the intimates
of the Prince of Wales, and the singular expedients
to which they had recourse to restore their shattered
fortunes at the expense of his character and fortune.'</p>

<p>On the death of Lord Coleraine, a contemporary<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> thus
sums up his character: 'He was, formerly, admitted
amongst the convivial companions of his present Majesty;
but, as the Prince advanced in life, the eccentric manners
of the Colonel became somewhat too free and coarse for
the Royal taste, and the broad vivacity of the facetious
Humourist gave way to associates of a more refined
description. But, though the Colonel was free in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
manners, he never was inclined to give intentional
offence, and the peculiarity of those manners precluded
all idea of resentment, and laughter, rather than anger,
was the result of his most extravagant sallies.</p>

<p>'He was capable of serious exertions of friendship,
not by pecuniary sacrifices, for, of such, his situation
hardly ever admitted, but by persevering zeal when he
was likely to effect a beneficial purpose. He was well
acquainted with military duty, and was never wanting
in courage, or the spirit of enterprise. He is generally
acknowledged to have been a very handsome man in
early life, but his person was disguised by the singularity
of his dress. Though disposed to participate in all the
dissipations of higher life, he yet contrived to devote
much of his time to reading, and was generally well
provided with topics for the usual conversations of the
table, even in the most convivial circles. He was so
marked a character that he might be considered as one
of the prominent features of his time, and he was courted
as well for the peculiarity, as for the harmless tendency
of his humour.'</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN 1784 the Prince of Wales had a somewhat
serious illness, and we read in the

<p>'<i>Extract from a letter from Brighthelmstone, July 25.</i>
The Prince of Wales is here quite as a private gentleman,
attended by Colonel Leigh, etc. He walks frequently
upon the Steine, and behaves with great affability and
politeness.'<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Brighthelmstone Intelligence.</span> <em>Brighthelmstone</em> is
the center <em>luminary</em> of the <em>system</em> of pleasure: Lymington,
Southampton and all other places within the <em>sphere</em>
of its <em>attraction</em>, lose their gayest visitants, who fly to
that resort:&mdash;the women, the pretty women, all hasten
to see the <em>Paris</em> of the day!&mdash;On Monday last, the
Dukes of <em>Chartres</em> and <em>Lauzun</em>, the Marquis <em>de Conflans</em>,
the Comte <em>de Seguir</em>, and others, arrived to be present
at the races. They came from France by the way of
Dover, but had all their equipage sent over from <em>Dieppe</em>.
The lively and engaging Comtesse <em>de Coniac</em> was to
have met them by the latter route at Brighthelmstone;
but some dæmon, unfriendly to gallantry, and to this
place, interposed, and procured an <i lang="fr">arret</i> to be expedited
from the Queen of France's bedchamber, just as the
sprightly belle was casting a longing eye from <em>Dieppe</em>
over to the British coast, and preparing to step into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the pacquet. This is a prodigious disappointment to
the company, and particularly to the <em>Prince</em>. His
Highness gave an elegant dinner at his house on the
<em>Steine</em>. The <em>Duc de Chartres</em> and his friends were
present: the meeting was festive and social. In the
evening, this convivial party visited the Rooms: the
company was genteel and numerous. The Prince danced
with Lady <em>Elizabeth Conway</em>, and was acknowledged the
best performer present.</p>

<p>'On Tuesday, the <em>Brighton Races</em> began, which
afforded but very little sport. The Duke of Queensberry's
was the favourite horse, but lost; and the <em>Duc
de Chartres</em>, who betted him against the field, got rid of
a good deal of money on the occasion. The sport was
not better the next day, but rather worse, on account
of the badness of the weather. All the Ladies attended
both days, mostly in carriages. Lady <em>Charlotte Bertie</em>
was the Constellation, or superior luminary of the course.
<i lang="la">Micavit inter omnes, quantum inter ignes Luna minores.</i>
Lady <em>Lincoln</em>, and her sister Lady <em>Betty Conway</em>, drove
about in a phaeton, to the great annoyance of the beaux.</p>

<p>'The public entertainments at Brighthelmstone are,
balls at the rooms twice a week, alternately at the <em>Ship</em>,
and <em>Castle</em>, and plays, the other four nights, at the
theatre. The balls are on Monday and Thursday; and
no dress is required except in those that dance minuets.
The rooms are, besides, open all the other nights for
card parties, and on <em>Sunday</em> for a promenade. The
Prince has not yet missed the Play house once, when
there has been a performance at it, since his arrival.
The pleasurable daughters of the place, have at their
head, Mrs. <em>Smith</em>, Mrs. <em>Elliot</em>, and Mrs. <em>Walker</em>; between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
whom an equipoise of rivalship and jealousy prevails,
and what one has in a <em>dimple</em>, is counteracted by the
lip, or the eye of the others.'<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Lewes Races.</span> The <em>Prince of Wales</em> is so regardless
of weather, that a shower of rain is never known to
interrupt his excursions. His Highness's indifference
on this head, reminds us of a remark of <em>Henry the Great</em>,
"that fate does not depend upon a sunbeam!"&mdash;The
example of the British prince was followed by his <em>insular</em>
friends and <em>Parisian</em> visitors. The road from Brighthelmstone
to Lewes, was crowded by <em>gentlemen jockies</em>
and <em>jockey sharpers</em>; carriages of various denominations,
and a company of all descriptions. The <em>Steine</em> was
depopulated of all save a few <em>living caricatures</em>, consisting
of antique Females, and <em>balloonified</em> squires from
the City, too awkward and unwieldy to wear boots, or
venture on horseback: to this class of beings, the ball
room was relinquished.</p>

<p>'The Course ground continued, during the races,
frequented by fashionable guests. Besides the English
and French princes, were present the Duc <em>de Lauzun</em>,
Marquis <em>de Conflans</em>, Count <em>Seguir</em>, the Russian minister,
and several others from the Continent. The Duke of
Queensberry, Lord Cholmondeley, Lord Foley, and many
more of the Jockey Club were on the ground.</p>

<p>'The Bets were high, though the sport was indifferent;
the Duke de Chartres, Duke of Queensberry and Sir
Charles Bunbury, were principally engaged in the success
of the day. The <em>Gallic Duke</em> was in such spirits, that
it was said his Highness would have mounted an <em>Air
balloon</em> had one been present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>'A <em>Pedestrian Race</em> was, also, proposed between a <em>fat
gentleman</em>, and a <em>lean one</em>: but the former complaining
that the atmosphere was low, gave up the contest as he
was fearful he should be <em>hard blowed</em>!'<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The Prince being at Brighton made all the difference
in the gaiety of the place, and his occasional absence in
London is thus commented upon: 'Brighthelmstone,
comparatively speaking, within these few days, has
become almost a desert; scarce a person of fashion
remains; the whole company now consists of <em>antiquated
virgins</em>, <em>emaciated beaux</em>, and wealthy citizens, with their
wives and daughters; the latter of whom have some
<em>weight</em> in continuing a few needy adventurers, who are
as watchful as lynxes, for an opportunity of carrying off
the golden prizes.'<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Note how this all changes when he returns. 'Extract
from a Letter from Brighthelmstone, dated Sep. 5.
We are all alive and merry here. Besides the honour
of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales's company,
we are favoured with those of the Duchess of Ancaster,
Lady Charlotte Bertie, Lady Mary Brudenell, the Bishop
of Winchester, Lord and Lady Beauchamp, the Right
Hon. Mr. Fox, with many others; and, last night, the
Right Hon. Mr. Pitt, accompanied by Mr. Steele, of
the Treasury, arrived here.</p>

<p>'The Prince of Wales was, last night, at the Theatre,
accompanied by the Hon. Mr. Erskine, and the Hon.
Mr. Onslow, to see the Beggar's Opera, the principal
parts of which were represented by gentlemen, and well
represented they were. Captain Ash's <em>Macheath</em> much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
exceeded many of the professional men on either of
your London theatres. It was succeeded by a well-timed
address, written and spoken by Mr. Bonner,
craving the friendly attendance of the company to the
future benefits of the several performers.'<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>We also learn by a newspaper paragraph<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> that 'the
house that the Prince of Wales has at Brighthelmstone,
is that which formerly belonged to Lord Egremont's
brother, Mr. Wyndham. The Duke of Cumberland
had it last year. The house is, or ought to be, the
best in the place.'</p>

<p>This is the house which we have seen was negotiated
for the Prince by Weltje, his clerk of the kitchen; at
least, this was his nominal title, but in reality he was
the Prince's purveyor of his household, and was much
mixed up in his financial matters. Louis Weltje was
a German of obscure origin, and it is said, at one time,
sold cakes in the streets. However, he must have had
something in him, and must also have been thrifty, for in
the newspapers of 1782 and 1783 we find several
mentions of Weltje's Club, and he had a famous pastry-cook's
shop and restaurant in St. James Street, and
afterwards in Pall Mall. In the satirical prints in the
British Museum for 1783, drawn by Captain Hays, is
'Mr. Weltjee's Fruit Shop, Pall Mall.' Madame
Weltje, a large woman, is seated at a horseshoe counter,
on which is a variety of fruit. In the window are displayed
pines, grapes, bottles, and jars. A manuscript
note says her shop was 'next door neighbour to
Mr. Neville.' He served the Prince for some years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
but was at last superseded. On his retirement he
bought a large house at Hammersmith, formerly in the
occupation of Lord Allington, the supporters of whose
arms, two talbots, decorated the gate-posts. In this
house, which he bequeathed to his brother Christopher,
he died, probably of apoplexy, in 1810, and was buried
in Hammersmith Churchyard. His name still exists
in the neighbourhood in Weltje Road, which runs from
the Upper Mall to King Street West, and consists of
sixty-eight houses.</p>

<p>We have seen that Fox was at Brighton in 1784.
Fox, who was the 'guide, philosopher, and friend' of
Prince Florizel, was at this time a man of about thirty-five
or thirty-six, having been born in 1749. By his
birth, education, and talents he should have been a
fitting companion for the Prince, but he was lax in his
morals, an inveterate gambler, and a hard drinker, and
a worse comrade for a young man could scarcely be
found. Indeed, at the end of the Westminster election
of 1784 Gillray caricatured him in a satirical print
entitled 'Preceptor and Pupil' as a loathsome toad
with a fox's brush, who is whispering into the ear of
the sleeping (or drunken) Prince: 'Abjure thy country
and thy parents, and I will give thee dominion over many
powers. Better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven!'</p>

<p>Apropos of this election, which lasted forty days, and
brought Fox in second at the poll, it is perhaps as
famous as any in our electoral history. Much to the
disgust of his parents, the Prince threw himself heart and
soul into the fray, wearing a 'Fox cockade' at Ranelagh,
and allowing members of his household to canvas for
his boon companion. During the election, Gillray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
produced a satirical print (April 18, 1784) called
'Returning from Brooks's,' where the Prince, exceedingly
drunk, and wearing the 'Fox cockade,' is being
helped along by Fox and Sam House, a publican who
kept a house, called The Intrepid Fox, at the corner of
Peter Street and Wardour Street. 'Honest Sam House,'
as he was called, was a violent politician and Whig,
and during this election kept open house at his own
expense. House figures in many caricatures of the
time, and his fame was even enshrined in verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">'See the brave Sammy House, he's as still as a mouse,<br /></div>
<div class="verse indent6">And does canvas with prudence so clever;<br /></div>

<div class="verse indent6">May his bald head be honour'd for ever!'<br /></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is another satirical print, which is dated
January, 1785, by an unknown artist, called 'Fox
singing a Song to the P&mdash;&mdash;e of W&mdash;l&mdash;s.' Fox and
the Prince are playing cards and drinking. Fox sings:</p>

<p>'The Prince of Wales has again taken a house at
Brighton for the season,' says the <cite>Morning Post</cite> of
June 11, 1785, and he left London for his seaside
residence on the 22nd of the same month. The same
newspaper of June 28 reports that 'the visit of a
certain gay, illustrious character at Brighton, has
frightened away a number of old maids, who used
constantly to frequent that place. The history of the
gallantries of the last season, which is in constant
circulation, has something in it so voluminous, and
tremendous to boot, that the old tabbies shake in their
shoes whenever his R&mdash;&mdash;l H&mdash;&mdash;ss is mentioned.'</p>

<p>'<i>Lewes, July 2.</i>&mdash;The Prince of Wales, on Monday
last, at Brighthelmstone, amused himself for some time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in attempting to shoot doves with single balls, but with
what success, we have not learnt; though we hear that
his Royal Highness is esteemed a most excellent shot,
and seldom presents his piece without doing some
execution. The Prince, in the course of his diversion,
either by design, or accident, lowered the tops of several
of the chimnies of the Hon. Mr. Wyndham's house.'<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>A few paragraphs from the <cite>Morning Post</cite> of this
year will give us a good insight into the Brighton of
the period.</p>

<p><i>July 6.</i>&mdash;'The <em>Brighthelmstone intelligence</em> has no
novelty to recommend it; merely a repetition of the
old story; <em>morning rides</em>, <em>champaigne</em>, <em>dissipation</em>, <em>noise</em>
and <em>nonsense</em>: jumble these phrases together, and you
have a complete account of all that's passing at <em>Brighthelmstone</em>!'</p>

<p><i>July 8.</i>&mdash;'A correspondent says, Brighthelmstone is
much altered from what it was last season. Neither
money, nor any speculating jewellers who give good
<em>tick</em>, and discount upon a <em>gentle feeling</em>. The &mdash;&mdash;
has been tried and found wanting&mdash;all about him is
not sterling&mdash;but one good <em>endorser</em> in the whole set,
and he abroad. Times are bad.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Johnson and Windsor have undertaken to
provide for the necessities of Brighton this year. The
<em>female adventurers</em> of last season were totally ruined:
even <em>Bet Cox</em>, who made as good a hand of it as any,
swears she will not run the risk again, and that, <em>though
as how</em> she was with the Prince, one night when he was
drunk, yet that did not compensate her for the wear
and tear with his attendants. We have not yet heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Mrs. <em>Smith's</em> opinion on the subject; but, as she was
nearer the fire, she could not well escape being scorched.'</p>

<p><i>August 4.</i>&mdash;'Brighthelmstone is at present very thin
of company, few females arriving there but the <i lang="fr">corps
d'amour</i>. Women of virtue and character shun these
scenes of debauchery and drunkenness, ever attendant
on the spot which is the temporary residence of a &mdash;&mdash;.'</p>

<p><i>August 18.</i>&mdash;'His Royal Highness the Prince is so
attached to his bathing residence, Brighthelmstone&mdash;he
has so many sea nymphs there, rising from Old Ocean
every morning to greet him; that, in the true spirit of
an <em>English Prince</em>, his sole desire appears to <em>rule the
waves</em>: and, when he comes to Town, he is actually like
<em>a fish out of water</em>.'</p>

<p><i>August 25.</i>&mdash;'Plague upon the <em>skippers</em> that they do
not understand the navigation of their own coasts! for,
surely, some of the Margate Hoys have blundered by
both the North and South Foreland, and landed their
cargoes on the Sussex Shore. Never were there such a
set of curmudgeonly knaves and dowdies, before, in
Brighton, say the conscientious keepers of the subscription
books! The lodging-houses are full, the streets
well frequented, and the Steyne crowded&mdash;but who
bathes, who raffles, and who subscribes? They vow
that they never had so little Gold in their Autumn
crop, since they were obliged to content themselves with
the profits of their fishing, to wash their smocks upon
the beach, and to live on crabs and pickled herrings!</p>

<p>'In fact, the visitors of this place are either a wiser, or
a poorer sort than formerly. <em>Snug</em> is the word with
most of them; they give as little into amusements,
dissipation and extra expences, as they can well avoid&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
hence, the obvious policy of the inhabitants to render
the necessary ones as high and as productive as possible&mdash;they
treat Londoners in their town as we treat Dutchmen
and others, in our charge for lights and landmarks&mdash;make
them come down handsomely, as it is to be
done but seldom. The innkeepers here, are a kind of
beasts of prey, whose rapacity is in proportion to their
former abstinence: they are leeches, who think a
plethora of the purse is no less dangerous than that of
the body; and, though you come here only to have
your constitution put to rights, they will, also, gladly
take charge of your property.</p>

<p>'An Irish gentleman being asked, the other day, by
a friend, which Inn he thought the best, observed that
they were both bad enough; at one you were <em>imposed
upon</em>; at the other, <em>cheated</em>. The Rooms have been
pretty well frequented on a Sunday, when it is the
Vauxhall price of admission. The play house must,
long since, have shut up, were it not for the <em>extraordinary
abilities</em> and <em>fertile resources</em> of Mr. <em>Fox</em>,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and
the patronage of the fair emigrants from Cleveland
Row, Jermyn Street, and King's Place&mdash;there have been
no gentlemen enactors, this year; so much the worse.
With deference, be it said, to the judgement of certain
titled ladies, who, adding to their <em>purity</em> by every
successive plunge into the salt water, pronounced the
mixture of gentlemen with professed actors, a perfect
contamination. Better sense, however, and more extra
liberality prevail at present; for ladies now ride to the
Downs to see Earls and great folks play at cricket, with
footmen and drivers, without having their delicacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
wounded, or their finer feelings deranged. That game
has become the favourite amusement with the young
men of fashion here. Mr. <em>St. John</em> is the best bowler;
Lord <em>Darnley</em> and <em>George Hanger</em> the best bats; <em>Bob</em>
the postillion, the best stopper behind the wicket. As
to his Royal Highness, he is but a young cricketer; the
ladies, however, commend his agility; and, since M<sup>rs</sup>
<em>J&mdash;n's</em> squad arrived, he has been famous for catching
and running.</p>

<p>'On Saturday last, the <em>Marquis de Conflans</em> took his
departure for <em>Dieppe</em>. The Prince and his company
went to see the Marquis embark, when a very extraordinary
and humorous scene was presented. It being
low water, the boat could not approach the shore&mdash;the
Marquis was anxious to get on board, and stood, for
some time, in suspence, when the Prince, to show him
that persons of their rank should not have the propensities
of cats, or the frippery of <i lang="fr">petits maîtres</i>, taking
one of his companions by the hand, rushed at once into
the water. The Marquis, <i lang="fr">pour l'honneur de la France</i>,
could not do otherwise than follow him; the line
advanced with resolution, but could not long withstand
the force of the waves, which overset them; they then
rolled like porpoises in the water, till they got the
Marquis aboard the packet; when they despatched
him, in a proper state, to pay his respects to the
<em>Dauphin</em>. <i lang="fr">Vive l'amour et l'allegresse, et bon voyage,
M. le Marquis!</i>'</p>

<p><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;'The flux and reflux of company not
being so great here as at some other places, there has
been very little novelty since my last intelligence. The
lodging-houses are, still, in general, full, though there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
are some occasionally to be disposed of at the following
reasonable rates: for a house upon the Steine, eight
guineas a week, or the same faced with blue and buff,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
for the trifling addition of two guineas (for which you
may have the credit of being a member of that party).<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Two beds, with a dining-room or parlour (the former,
perhaps, being supplied with a good <em>live stock</em>) for three
guineas; and, for a guinea per week, a single gentleman
may be accommodated with an apartment, where,
if he finds himself streightened for want of room, he
may be gratified, at least, with a prospect of better
things, and have the view of a large piece of water,
commonly called the English Channel. Hence, too, he
may form some idea of our naval grandeur, by contemplating
the fleet, as it lies at anchor before the town,
consisting, at least, of an hundred sail&mdash;of fishing
smacks; or, he may indulge in a peep of the ladies
dipping into the water, or bobbing at a wave in rough
weather; for the Master of the Ceremonies has judiciously
assigned them the place nearest to the houses, and
has sent the gentlemen, for <em>decency's sake</em>, two hundred
yards further to the westward.</p>

<p>'If we may believe <em>the printed list</em>, half the fashionable
persons, and about one-fourth of the w&mdash;&mdash;s of
London, have visited Brighton in the course of the
summer; but, for those of the most consideration, who
are to be seen in their shoes, as well as upon the List
of the Company, take the following names: His Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Highness and suite, more respectable, though not as
numerous as last year; the Earl and Dowager Countess
of Darnley, with her family; Earl and Countess of
Clermont; Lord and Lady Beauchamp; the Countess
of Shaftesbury and family; Baron and Baroness Nolcken;
Lord Belgrave; Lord Lucan, with his family; Lord
and Lady Lisle; Lord Gage; Sir Sampson and Lady
Gideon; Sir Eardley Wilmot; Earl and Countess of
Sefton; Lord Herbert; Sir Godfrey Webster; Mr.
Wyndham; Mr. T. Townsend; Mr. St. John. Some
city beaux sport their gigs upon the downs, and their
persons upon the Steine: they would fain be thought
men of fashion, but their very best airs in the ballroom
partake of Coachmaker's Hall; the City dancing-masters
being ten years behindhand in the refinements
of their profession. There is very little show of beauty
in the Rooms. Among the young ladies of family,
<em>Miss Bingham</em>, daughter of Lord Lucan, is almost the
only one that deserves notice in that particular; and,
however singular, in this place, it is a fact that one of
the ladies who has been most distinguished for elegance,
is a Miss I&mdash;&mdash;s, from <em>Cow Lane</em>, West Smithfield!</p>

<p>'The Rooms, as I hinted before, have been almost
deserted, except on particular nights. At the last ball
but one, at the <em>Ship</em>, only seven couple stood up, and
the lady who took the lead, according to the etiquette
established in pride and folly, was <i lang="la">pro</i> <span class="smcap">NUMMORUM</span> <i lang="la">atque
hominum fidem credite</i>!&mdash;no less a person than Mrs.
Tr&mdash;&mdash;d, daughter of the naval baronet, who, in his
lifetime, gained many signal advantages over the tribes
of Benjamin and Levi. The <em>Castle</em> has been somewhat
more fortunate. But Fox, the manager, has been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
successful, as to excite the envy of his rivals, who have
it in contemplation to set up a theatre in opposition to
his. It was for this purpose that <em>Signor Grimaldi's</em>
journey was undertaken, which, by the newspaper
accounts, proved so fatal to him; and, as he, with
Mr. <em>Spencer</em>, the harlequin, is to have the principal
concern, we may expect that the prime parts of the
entertainment at the new Theatre, will be pantomime,
with <em>grinning</em> and <em>jumping</em> in abundance. If Mr.
<em>Grimaldi</em> should bring down his young pupils from the
Circus, it will, perhaps, be necessary for Mr. Fox to
engage the General Jackoo, or the Dancing Dogs. At
present, he confines his attempts to Comic Opera,
Comedy, and Farce; and, for these, it must be confessed,
he has good materials. His company may be
called a good one&mdash;for the country&mdash;though the greatest
part are recruits, and want drilling. Yet, why for <em>the
country</em>, when there are so many London performers
without engagements in the summer.</p>

<p>'The most extraordinary event that has happened
lately, was a violent gale on Tuesday, which caused
many sad accidents. The wind blew with prodigious
force from the southward, and brought an uncommonly
high tide with it. This rendered it necessary to draw
up all the small craft, and the machines upon the Steine,
where most of the Company, particularly the Londoners,
assembled to gaze at a sea storm. The Prince's curiosity
got him a ducking, and an old man and his ass were
drowned under the Cliff.'</p>

<p>The Prince's acquaintance with Mrs. Fitzherbert&mdash;His courtship
and marriage&mdash;Satirical prints thereon.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/w.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS year was exceedingly fateful to Prince
Florizel, for, in it, he made the acquaintance
of a lady whose connection with him
influenced his whole life. This was Maria
Anne Fitzherbert, daughter of Walter
Smythe, Esq., of Brambridge, in the county of Hants,
second son of Sir John Smythe, Bart., of Eske, in the
county of Durham, and Acton Burnell, in Shropshire.
She was born in July, 1756, and married, in July, 1775,
Edward Weld, Esq., of Lulworth Castle, county Dorset,
who died in the course of the same year. She married,
secondly, Thomas Fitzherbert, Esq., of Swinnerton,
county Stafford, in the year 1778. This gentleman only
survived their union three years, losing his life in consequence
of his exertions during the Lord George Gordon
Riots. Being much heated, he bathed, and brought on
the malady which, soon after, occasioned his death.</p>

<p>Behold her, then, in 1785 a fascinating young widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
with a competent fortune, moving in the highest society,
and of so much importance as to be made the subject
of newspaper paragraphs long before she met the Prince.
<cite>Morning Herald</cite>, March 20, 1784.&mdash;'Mrs. <em>Fitzherbert</em> is
arrived in London for the winter.' And again, <cite>Morning
Herald</cite>, July 27, 'A new <em>constellation</em> has lately made
an appearance in the <em>fashionable hemisphere</em>, that engages
the attention of those whose hearts are susceptible to
the power of beauty. The widow of the late Mr.
F&mdash;h&mdash;t has in her train half our young Nobility: as the
lady has not, as yet, discovered a partiality for any of her
admirers, they are all animated with hopes of success.'</p>

<p>Cosway painted a charming picture of her, which,
engraved by Condé, is reproduced as the frontispiece
to this volume.</p>

<p>Huish<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> gives an erroneous account of the acquaintance
of the Prince and Mrs. Fitzherbert, but I give it so that
the reader may contrast it with that of Lord Stourton,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
who was her intimate friend and near connection. 'The
first time that the Prince of Wales saw Mrs. Fitzherbert,
was in Lady Sefton's box at the Opera; and the novelty
of her face, more than the brilliancy of her charms, had
the usual effect of enamouring the Prince. But in this
instance he had not to do with a raw inexperienced girl,
but with an experienced dame, who had been twice a
widow, and who, consequently, was not likely to
surrender upon common terms. She looked forward
to a more brilliant prospect which her ambition might
artfully suggest, founded upon the feeble character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
an amorous young Prince; and, when his Royal
Highness first declared himself her admirer, she gave
him not the slightest hopes of success; but, in the true
spirit of the finished coquette, she turned away from
his protestations; and, in order to avoid his importunities,
quitted the kingdom, and took up her
residence at Plombiers, in Lorrain, in France. The
lovely idol knew that an object which is easily gained,
is seldom esteemed or prized: the Prince, indeed, from
his peculiar situation as Heir apparent, could not follow
her, although it is stated, in an anonymous letter preserved
in the British Museum, that his Royal Highness
did once travel to Paris incog. and that he had, there,
an interview with Mrs. Fitzherbert, the consequence of
which was, her immediate return to England. As there
is no other authority for this act of his Royal Highness,
and taking the improbability of the event into consideration,
it must be left with all the doubt attached
to it, acknowledging, at the same time, that the preponderancy
leans to the side of its being a fiction.'</p>

<p>Now let us hear Lord Stourton's version, which bears
the impress of truth upon it, judging by the almost
universal testimony as to Mrs. Fitzherbert's character:</p>

<p>'In the midst of the afflictions, both of body and
mind, which weighed down the latter years of Mrs.
Fitzherbert, the thought which most soothed her pains,
and assuaged her grief, was the consoling testimony
which would be borne to her character, when she should
be no more; when all the actors in this extraordinary
drama being removed by the hand of death, the veil
might be drawn aside which had prompted secrecy
during her life; and her character might be shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
posterity in the light which it appeared to herself, unsullied
by crime, and even untarnished by interestedness
or ambition. With this view, she almost insisted, in
our confidential communications, upon my requiring
from her every information respecting her conduct,
from her first connection with George the Fourth,
down to his death&mdash;as evidence to satisfy my mind of
the strictest propriety of every portion of her conduct,
that I might deem doubtful, or objectionable.</p>

<p>'After disclosures so intimate, and, to my judgment,
so satisfactory, I should not wish to descend into the
tomb myself, leaving her reputation to the doubtful
testimony of others, less informed, even if equally
disposed to render her justice. Associated with some,
in the custody of a few important papers relative to her
history, I stand single in a nearer relationship to this
distinguished person, in some important and intimate
connections, and was, therefore, selected by her on that
account, to be honoured with communications of so
very delicate and confidential a nature. Having
deliberately accepted the proffered confidence, I should
not feel happy to leave to the chances of ill-advised or
mercenary biographers the portraiture of one so difficult
to pencil in her true and accurate lineaments.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Fitzherbert was first acquainted with the Prince
when residing on Richmond Hill, and soon became the
object of his most ardent attentions. During this
period she was made the subject of a popular ballad,
which designated her, under the title of the "Sweet
Lass of Richmond Hill."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">'"I'd crowns resign to call her mine,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Sweet lass of Richmond Hill."<br /></div>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>She was, then, the widow of Mr. Fitzherbert, in possession
of an independent fortune of nearly £2,000 a
year, admired and caressed by all who were acquainted
with her character and singular attractions.</p>

<p>'Surrounded by so many personal advantages, and
the widow of an individual to whom she had been
singularly attached, she was very reluctant to enter
into engagements fraught with so many embarrassments;
and, when viewed in their fairest light, exposing
their object to great sacrifices and difficulties. It is
not, therefore, surprising that she resisted, with the
utmost anxiety and firmness, the flattering assiduities
of the most accomplished Prince of his age. She was
well aware of the gulf that yawned beneath those
flattering demonstrations of royal adulation.</p>

<p>'For some time her resistance had been availing, but
she was about to meet with a species of attack so unprecedented
and alarming, as to shake her resolution,
and to force her to take that first step, which, afterwards,
led by slow (but on the part of the Prince,
successful) advances, to that union which he so ardently
desired, and to obtain which he was ready to risk such
personal sacrifices. Keit (Keate), the surgeon, Lord
Onslow, Lord Southampton, and Mr. Edward Bouverie,
arrived at her house in the utmost consternation, informing
her that the life of the Prince was in imminent
danger&mdash;that he had stabbed himself, and that only
<em>her</em> immediate presence would save him.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> She resisted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in the most peremptory manner, all their importunities,
saying that nothing should induce her to enter Carlton
House. She was, afterwards, brought to share in the
alarm, but, still, fearful of some stratagem derogatory
to her reputation, insisted upon some lady of high
character accompanying her, as an indispensable condition:
the Duchess of Devonshire was selected. They
four drove from Park Street to Devonshire House, and
took her along with them. She found the Prince
pale, and covered with blood. The sight so overpowered
her faculties, that she was almost deprived of
all consciousness. The Prince told her that nothing would
induce him to live unless she promised to become his
wife, and permitted him to put a ring round her finger.
I believe a ring from the hand of the Duchess of
Devonshire was used upon the occasion, and not one
of his own. Mrs. Fitzherbert being asked by me,
whether she did not believe that some trick had been
practised, and that it was not really the blood of his
Royal Highness, answered in the negative; and said
she had frequently seen the scar, and some brandy and
water was near his bedside when she was called to him
on the day he wounded himself.</p>

<p>'They returned to Devonshire House. A deposition
was drawn up of what had occurred, and signed and
sealed by each one of the party; and, for all she knew
to the contrary, might still be there. On the next
day, she left the country, sending a letter to Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Southampton, protesting against what had taken place,
as not being then a free agent. She retired to Aix la
Chapelle, and, afterwards, to Holland. The Prince
went down into the country to Lord Southampton's,
for change of air.</p>

<p>'In Holland, she met with the greatest civilities
from the Stadtholder and his family, lived upon terms
of intimacy with them, and was received into the
friendship of the Princess of Orange, who, at that time,
was the object of negotiation with the Royal Family of
England, for the Heir apparent. Frequent inquiries
were made about the Prince and the English Court,
in confidential communications between her and the
Princess, it being wholly unknown to the Princess that
she was her most dangerous rival. She said she was
often placed in circumstances of considerable embarrassment;
but, her object being to break through her own
engagements, she was not the hypocrite she might have
appeared afterwards, as she would have been very happy
to have furthered this alliance. She afterwards saw
this Princess in England, and continued to enjoy her
friendship, but there was always a great coolness on the
part of the Stadtholder towards her.</p>

<p>'She left Holland in the Royal Barge, and spent
above another year abroad, endeavouring to "fight off"
(to use her own phrase) a union fraught with such
dangerous consequences to her peace and happiness.
Couriers after couriers passed through France, carrying
the letters and propositions of the Prince to her in
France and Switzerland. The Duke of Orleans was the
medium of this correspondence. The speed of the
couriers exciting the suspicion of the French Govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ment,
three of them were, at different times, put into
prison. Wrought upon, and fearful, from the past, of
the desperation of the Prince, she consented, formally
and deliberately, to promise that she would never marry
any other person; and, lastly, she was induced to return
to England, and agree to become his wife, on those
conditions which satisfied her own conscience, though
she could have no legal claim to be the wife of the
Prince.</p>

<p>'I have seen a letter of thirty-seven pages, written,
as she informed me, not long before this step was taken,
entirely in the handwriting of the Prince; in which it
is stated by him that his Father would connive at the
union. She was then hurried to England, anticipating
too clearly and justly, that she was about to plunge
into inextricable difficulties; but, having insisted upon
conditions, such as would satisfy her conscience, and
justify her in the eyes of her own Church, she abandoned
herself to her fate. Immediately after her return, she
was married to the Prince, according to the rites of the
Catholic Church in this country; her uncle Harry
Errington and her brother Jack Smythe being witnesses
to the contract, along with the Protestant clergyman
who officiated at the ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> No Roman Catholic
priest officiated. A certificate of this marriage is extant
in the handwriting of the Prince, and with his signature
and that of Maria Fitzherbert. The witnesses' names
were added; but, at the earnest request of the parties,
in a time of danger, they were afterwards cut out by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Mrs. Fitzherbert herself, with her own scissors, to save
them from the peril of the law.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>'This, she afterwards regretted; but a letter of the
Prince, on her return to him, has been preserved, to
supply any deficiency, in which he thanks God, that
the witnesses to their union were still living; and,
moreover, the letter of the officiating clergyman is still
preserved, together with another document with the
signature and seal, but not in the handwriting, of the
Prince, in which he repeatedly terms her his wife.'</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these papers are now deposited
in Coutts's Bank, sealed up in a cover under the seals
of the Duke of Wellington, Sir William Knighton, the
Earl of Albemarle, and Lord Stourton. All other
correspondence was destroyed, on the death of
George IV., by Mrs. Fitzherbert herself in the presence
of the Duke of Wellington and the Earl of Albemarle.
The packet consists of:</p>

<p>1. The mortgage on the palace at Brighton.</p>

<p>2. The certificate of the marriage, dated December 21,
1785.</p>

<p>3. A letter from George IV. relating to the marriage
(signed).</p>

<p>4. A will written by George IV.</p>

<p>5. Memorandum written by Mrs. Fitzherbert, attached
to a letter written by the clergyman who performed the
marriage ceremony.</p>

<p>With regard to this mortgage on the Pavilion, Lord
Stourton says:<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> 'To the Duke of York and the Queen,
Mrs. Fitzherbert was indebted for £6,000 a year in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
mortgage deed, which they procured for her on the
Palace at Brighton; being aware, as she said, that till
that period, she had no legal title to a single shilling
should she survive the Prince. Indeed, at one period,
she had debts upon her own jointures, incurred principally
on account of the Prince; and, when the Duke of Wellington,
as executor to George IV., asked her if she had
anything to show, or claim upon the personalty of the
deceased Sovereign, she told him she had not even a
scrap of paper, for that she had never, in her life, been
an interested person.'</p>

<p>We have seen that the marriage took place on
December 21, 1785; but it was noised about before
then, as we may see by the two following cuttings from
the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, December 16, 1785: 'It is whispered
in the circles of gallantry, that a certain illustrious
character has made a delicate and honourable engagement
with a Lady of superior accomplishments; that
she is to have the full direction of his household, with
a settlement of £8,000 a year, the &mdash;&mdash;'s liveries, with
an engagement to create her a Duchess, if ever he should
have the power.'</p>

<p><i>December 17, 1785.</i>&mdash;'A very extraordinary treaty is
on the tapis, between a beautiful young Widow, who
resides about ten miles from London, in the county of
Surrey, and a Gentleman of <em>high rank</em>, in the neighbourhood
of St. James's. Fame speaks highly of the Lady's
virtues, and her accomplishments; and, as conscious of
her value, she has taken care to set a very high price
upon her person: the terms are that she should be the
mistress of the young Gentleman's town house, to preside
at his table, to have a settlement of Six thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
pounds per annum: her equipages and liveries to be
the same as her lover's; and, when it shall be <em>in his
power</em>, the Lady to be created a Duchess in her own
right:&mdash;These conditions, it is said, are already agreed
to; and, in a very short time, the amorous treaty will
be signed and sealed.'</p>

<p>The caricaturist did not linger long afterwards, and
the earliest of the satirical prints bearing on this subject
is one dated March 13, 1786, supposed to be drawn by
'Fitz,' called 'The Follies of a Day, or the Marriage of
Figaro.' The Prince is just putting the ring on Mrs.
Fitzherbert's hand. They are being married by a sham
parson&mdash;Weltje, in fact, as is evidenced by the corkscrew
which he wears in lieu of a crucifix, whilst out of his
pocket appears a scroll endorsed 'Weltjie's Nat(uralizatio)<sup>n</sup>
Bill.' The book from which he reads is 'Hoyle's
Games,' and the page is headed 'Matrimony.' George
Hanger is the sole witness.</p>

<p>Others follow, and they are all as wide of the real
facts of the case as is this one.</p>

<p><i>March 20, 1786</i>&mdash;'The Royal Toast&mdash;Fat, Fair, and
Forty,' is a fancy portrait of Mrs. Fitzherbert, very stout,
a fact as truthful as her age, which was but thirty.</p>

<p><i>March 21, 1786</i>&mdash;'Wedding Night, or the Fashionable
Frolic.' The Prince and Mrs. Fitzherbert are
dancing, and George Hanger is playing the 'Black
Joke' on a fiddle. A marriage certificate, torn up,
lies on the floor.</p>

<p><i>March 21, 1786</i>&mdash;'The Lovers' Leap.' The Prince
and Mrs. Fitzherbert are preparing to jump over a broom
(which is said to be the gipsies' marriage ceremony),
which lies on the floor between them. George Hanger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
is pushing the Prince on, and a cat is jumping out of
a bag.</p>

<p>Another version of this, by Gillray, was published on
the same date, and is thus described in Wright and
Grego's 'Gillray':</p>

<p>'<i>21 Mar., 1786.</i>&mdash;<em>'Twas nobody saw the Lovers'
Leap and let the Cat out of the Bag.</em> This title, which
refers to the first disclosure of the scandal, is literally
treated in the print. Fox appears as "nobody," and a
cat is seen escaping from a bag. The Whig chief, with
whom, as the occasional companion of the young Prince's
excesses, the public were not slow to connect the transaction,
is encouraging Florizel to "leap over the broomstick"
with Mrs. Fitzherbert. The ex favourites, in a
second apartment, surmounted by the Prince's crest,
tranquilly regard the coming change. "All I desire of
mortal man is to love whilst he can," says Perdita.
"Well said, Robby," remarks a gentleman at table:
"his father will broomstick him!"'</p>

<p>The best etching on the subject is dated March 27,
1786, and is called 'Wife and no Wife; or, A Trip to
the Continent.' The Prince is about to put the ring
on Mrs. Fitzherbert's hand, and Fox is giving her away.
Hanger and Sheridan are witnesses. Burke, as a Jesuit,
is reading the marriage service, and Lord North, as a
coachman, is fast asleep.</p>

<img src="images/i_092fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">WIFE AND NO WIFE; OR, A TRIP TO THE CONTINENT.</div>
</div>

<p>Then we have on May 1, 1786, 'The April Fool, or
the Follies of a Night, as performed at the Theatre
Royal, C&mdash;&mdash;n House, for the Benefit of the Widow
Wadman.' The Prince, Mrs. Fitzherbert, and George
Hanger are dancing, while Fox is drumming with a
pistol on a warming-pan, exclaiming, 'Damme, but 'tis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
sublime;' and Burke, who says, 'Burn the pan, is it not
beautiful?' plays on a gridiron with a pair of tongs.
On the walls are two scenes from <em>Hamlet</em>: one where
Polonius says to the King, 'I will be brief, your noble
son is mad;' the other where Hamlet says to Ophelia:</p>

<div class="verse">Carve for himself, for on his choice depends<br /></div>
<div class="verse">The sanity and health of the whole state.'<br /></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the ground lie two plays, 'A Bold Stroke for a
Wife'<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and 'The Clandestine Marriage.'<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><i>May 1, 1786.</i>&mdash;'An Extravaganza, or Young Solomon
besieging Fitzhubbub, the Governess of the Fort and
Garrison of Fitzhubbub, after a political resistance of
time proper, surrenders to the besieger, as by the articles
of capitulation.' The Prince is kneeling before Mrs.
Fitzherbert, who, seated on a sofa, points to 'Articles
of Capitulation, £8,000 per annum. A Duchess in my
own right. The mockery of <span class="smcap">Marriage</span> by a Priest and
a Parson.'</p>

<p><i>May 3, 1786.</i>&mdash;'The Introduction of F&mdash;&mdash; to St.
James's.' A view of the gateway of St. James's Palace.
The Prince is carrying Mrs. Fitzherbert on his shoulders,
preceded by George Hanger beating a drum, and by Fox
and Captain Morris playing on trumpet and horn, whilst
Burke brings up the rear playing on a flageolet.</p>

<p>The Prince, personally, took no heed of these pictorial
satires; but others thought differently of them, as we
learn by the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, April 24, 1786: 'His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales has been frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
entreated to take legal cognizance of the numerous
libellous prints, and other scandalous reports, which
have lately been in circulation; but, with a magnanimity
of soul congenial with the spirit of British freedom, he
constantly declined it, with expressions of jocularity: at
the same time, thinking the authors unworthy of his
notice. The laws of his country have, at last, interfered,
and common decency requires that the most rigorous
measures should now be pursued to punish the offenders.&mdash;Indictments
have been preferred, and the Bills were
found, on Friday last, at the Guildhall, Westminster,
against&mdash;<em>Ford</em>, of Piccadilly, for having published
and circulated some infamous prints, with an intent to
satyrize and libel his Royal Highness, the Prince of
Wales; which prints, we understand, were shown to a
great law Lord, by an indifferent person; and, in consequence,
his Lordship pronounced them most infamous
libels, and ordered the present prosecutions to be instituted
against the publishers thereof.'</p>

<p>The newspapers notice the new opera-box of Mrs.
Fitzherbert, and also her new house in St. James's
Square, formerly in the occupation of Lord Uxbridge.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/e.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">EARLY in 1786 matters financial came to
a crisis with Florizel. Notwithstanding
his income of nearly £70,000, he had
managed in less than three years to get
some £300,000 in debt. Harassed by his
creditors, he had no resource left but to apply to his
father, but from him he got naught but good counsel. In
this dilemma Pitt was applied to, and asked to furnish
£250,000. This not being forthcoming, the King was
written to, who replied, asking for a detailed statement of
liabilities. This was furnished, and so astonished the King
that he declined the proposal, and declared that he would
never sanction an increase to his son's income. Then
Florizel wrote another letter to his father, announcing his
determination to retrench violently, and set aside £40,000
a year towards the payment of his debts. To which the
King replied, that if he chose to take a rash step, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
must likewise take the consequences. Then the Prince
once more took his pen in hand, and wrote a letter to
his father, which closed the correspondence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>'I have had the honour of receiving your
Majesty's written message, transmitted to me by Lord
Southampton, and am greatly concerned that my poor
sentiments cannot coincide with those of your Majesty,
in thinking that the former message which I had the
honour of receiving, in your Majesty's own hand, was
not a refusal. After having repeatedly sent in various
applications to your Majesty, for two years successively,
representing that a partial reduction out of so incompetent
an income as mine, was to no purpose towards
the liquidation of a debt, where the principal and
interest were so considerable, I, this year, humbly requested
your Majesty that you would be graciously
pleased (having previously laid my affairs before you,
Sir, for your inspection, and painted them in the distressed
colours which they so justly merited), whenever
it suited your conveniency, to favour me with a decisive
answer; as the various delays which have occurred,
through the course of this business, have, in reality,
proved more pernicious to me in the situation in which
I have been for some time past involved, than the
original embarrassment of the debt. To not only these,
but to any future delays, would I have, most willingly,
submitted, had they really rested upon my own patience;
but the pressing importunities of many indigent and
deserving creditors (some of them whose very existence

made too forcible an appeal to the justice becoming my
own honour, and to the feelings of my heart, to be any
longer delayed. Another consideration is, that any
further procrastination might have exposed me to legal
insults, as humiliating to me, as, I am persuaded, they
would be to your Majesty. I, therefore, previously to
my having the honour of receiving that message, had
determined, that, should I not be so fortunate as to
meet with that relief from you, Sir, with which I had
flattered myself, and which I thought I had the greatest
reason to expect, I would exert every nerve to render
that just redress and assistance to my creditors, which I
cannot help thinking is denied to me. These are the
motives, Sir, that have actuated my conduct in the step
I have taken, of reducing every expence in my family, even
those to which my birth and rank entitle me (and which,
I trust, will ever continue to be the principle and guide
of my conduct), till I have totally liberated myself
from the present embarrassments which oppress me; and
the more so, as I am persuaded that such a line, when
pursued with consistency, will meet with the approbation
of every candid and dispassionate mind.</p>

<p>'I will not trespass any further on your Majesty's
time, but have the honour to subscribe myself,</p>

<p>'<i>July 9, 1786.</i>'</p></blockquote>

<p>After the despatch of this letter he immediately acted
on it; gave orders to curtail his household, to stop all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
building and decoration of Carlton House, and to sell
his race and carriage horses, with a very few reservations,
and go and ruralise at Brighton, which he reached
on July 11. The newspapers and caricaturists, of
course, immediately made capital out of it, <i lang="la">vide</i> the
<cite>Morning Post</cite>, July 13, 1786: 'A morning paper of
yesterday says that the <em>Prince of Wales</em> set off for
<em>Brighton</em> in a <em>hired chaise</em> and <em>hack horses</em>; but we are
informed by authority, which we trust will meet with
<em>equal credit</em>, that his Royal Highness was an <em>outside
passenger</em> by the <em>Brighton Dilly</em>.'</p>

<p>And the caricaturist followed quickly in the wake of
the newspaper men with a satirical print published on
July 15, called 'A Trip to Brighton, or the P&mdash;&mdash;
and his reduced Household returning for the summer
season.' The Prince and Mrs. Fitzherbert are inside
the carriage, and the latter is studying the 'Principles
of Œconomy.' The carriage is laden with household
effects, vegetables, meat, etc., and with small beer and
raisin wine. One of the footmen is Fox, the other
George Hanger, who is reading, 'For Sale, at Tattersall's,
the Prince's Stud.' Weltje, 'Purveyor, Coachman,
Cook and Butler,' is driving.</p>

<p>There is another, which, although not dated, is
evidently of the same period, called 'The Brighton
Stud,' in which is seen a groom leading three donkeys&mdash;George
Hanger, Fox, and Sheridan. The Prince
rides another donkey (Mrs. Fitzherbert), and Lord
Derby (as another) looks on. This evidently refers to
the sale of the Prince's stud, which realized somewhat
over £7,000. Mrs. Fitzherbert went to Brighton
immediately after the Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a very amusing satirical print dated
August 23, 1786, the best part of which is the verse
attached. It is called 'The Jovial Crew, or Merry
Beggars. A Comic Opera, as performed at Brighton
by the Carleton Company.' The Prince and Mrs.
Fitzherbert occupy the centre of the picture. The
Prince has a hat full of money, '£7,586. By sale of
the Stud,' and Mrs. Fitzherbert carries a child on her
back. The other beggars, who are mostly on crutches,
are on either side.</p>

<p>There is a very clever satirical print which refers to
the breaking up of the Prince's establishment. It is
called 'The School for Scandal,' and parodies the scene
from Sheridan's play, in which Charles Surface helps to
knock down the portraits of his ancestors. George
Hanger is the auctioneer, and Lot 1 is a picture of the
King and Queen, 'Farmer George and his Wife.'
Hanger cries out, 'Going for no more than one Crown!'
and the Prince thus encourages the Colonel, 'Careless,
knock down the Farmer.' One of the audience bids
five shillings for the royal pair. Lot 2 is a portrait of
Mrs. Fitzherbert, and Lot 3 one of Perdita. Through
the open door is seen Tattersall's, where the Prince's
stud, etc., were sold. A carriage is numbered Lot 1,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to show the extravagance of the Prince's stable arrangements.</p>

<p>A piece of gossip about the Prince at Brighton
appears in the <cite>Morning Post</cite> of September 25, 1786:
'We hear that the Prince of Wales, a few days since,
was suddenly indisposed at Brighthelmstone; and, at
the same time, several gentlemen who had dined with
the Prince at a friend's table, the preceding day, were
seized with symptoms similar to those of his Royal
Highness. They were all more or less affected, according
to the quantity each eat of a particular dish
at table. Happily for his Royal Highness, he eat
but moderately; and we have the pleasure to add, he
has now quite recovered. Mr. Keate, the Prince's
surgeon, has been sent for from London; and the business
terminated so favourably, no other assistance was
called in.'</p>

<p>During his stay this year he was very quiet, only
going to the races, and superintending the alterations
to his house, which were completed the ensuing spring.
He left Brighton for the season on October 17.</p>

<p>The Prince kept his promise of retrenchment for nine
long months, and was sorely put to it for money&mdash;a
fact of which the caricaturist took full advantage.
Thus, on January 18, 1787, we have 'The Prodigal
Son,' in which the Prince is depicted as seated on the
bare ground, feeding swine; his coat is out at elbows
and breeches unfastened; his Garter has gone, and his
three feathers lie on the ground.</p>

<p>Then, on February 26 there is 'Love's Last Shift,'
which represents the Prince and Mrs. Fitzherbert in
the last stage of poverty. The Prince sits before a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
fire, turning a sheep's head, which hangs by a string,
and rocking a cradle in which a child lies sleeping, an
event which, happily, did not occur during his connection
with Mrs. Fitzherbert. He has no breeches on,
because Mrs. Fitzherbert is mending them. Weltje
has just brought in some potatoes, and George Hanger
has a small measure of beer.</p>

<p>The Prince's friends felt that this could not go on
longer. It was resolved to appeal to Parliament for aid,
and Mr. Nathaniel Newnham, a merchant, Alderman,
and an M.P. for the City of London, was chosen to open
the matter, which he did on April 20, 1787, by asking
Mr. Pitt whether it was his intention to bring forward
any proposition to rescue the Prince of Wales from his
embarrassed and distressed situation. Being answered
by the Minister that he had no commands to that
purpose from the King, the Alderman gave notice
that, on Friday, May 4, he would bring forward a
motion upon that subject for the consideration of the
House.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="LOVES_LAST_SHIFT"></a>
<img src="images/i_102fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">LOVE'S LAST SHIFT.</div>
</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, the motion was brought before
the House on April 27, and again on April 30, when
Fox supported the Prince, and in the course of his
speech, referring to the rumour of the Prince being
married to Mrs. Fitzherbert (a Roman Catholic), said:
'With respect to the allusion to something full of
"danger to the Church and State," made by the hon.
gentleman, one of the members of the County of Devon,
till that gentleman thought proper to explain himself,
it was impossible to say with any certainty to what
that allusion referred; but he supposed it must be
meant in reference to that miserable calumny, that low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
malicious falsehood, which had been propagated without
doors, and made the wanton sport of the vulgar. In
that House, where it was known how frequent and
common the falsehoods of the times were, he hoped a
tale, only fit to impose on the lowest order of persons
in the streets, would not have gained the smallest
portion of credit; but, when it appeared that an invention
so monstrous, a report of a fact which had not the
smallest degree of foundation, a report of a fact actually
impossible to have happened, had been circulated with
so much industry, as to have made an impression on
the minds of the members of that House, it proved, at
once, the uncommon pains taken by the enemies of his
Royal Highness to propagate the grossest and most
malignant falsehoods, with a view to depreciate his
character, and injure him in the opinion of his country....
The whole of the debt the Prince was ready to
submit to the investigation of the House; and he was
equally ready to submit the other circumstance to which
he had alluded, to their consideration, provided that
the consideration of a House of Parliament could, consistently
with propriety and decency, be applied to such
a subject. Nay, his Royal Highness had authorised
him to declare that, as a Peer of Parliament, he was
ready in the other House to submit to any of the most
pointed questions which could be put to him respecting
it, or to afford his Majesty, or his Majesty's ministers,
the fullest assurances of the utter falsehood of the fact
in question, which never had, and which common sense
must see, never could have happened.'</p>

<p>In a later part of the debate 'Mr. Fox answered, that
he did not deny the calumny in question merely with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
regard to the effect of certain existing laws, alluded to
by the hon. gentleman; but he denied it <i lang="la">in toto</i>, in
point of fact, as well as of law. The fact not only
never could have happened legally, but never did happen
in any way whatsoever, and had, from the beginning,
been a base and malicious falsehood.'</p>

<p>The debate was again resumed on May 4, when
Mr. Alderman Newnham rose, and said: 'Sir, I am
extremely happy that the motion which I was to have
had the honour of making, this day, is no longer
necessary; and it is with the most sincere and heartfelt
satisfaction that I inform the House that I decline
bringing it forward.'</p>

<p>The following is a note to p. 1074 of vol. xxvi. of
Hansard: 'On Sunday the 29th, or Monday the
30th of April, an intimation was given at Cumberland
House, that, if the Prince had no objection, Mr. Dundas
would be glad to have an interview with his Royal
Highness. On this being communicated to the Prince,
he sent back word that he was ready to see him whenever
he should call at Carlton House. Accordingly, on
Wednesday, the 2nd of May, late in the evening,
Mr. Dundas had a long general conversation with the
Prince, which ended with Mr. Dundas requesting that
the Prince would permit Mr. Pitt himself to wait upon
him. To that, his Royal Highness assented; and
Mr. Pitt, in conformity, was with the Prince at Carlton
House, the next day, for more than two hours: in this
long conversation, the Prince stated all his circumstances
to Mr. Pitt, who then promised to lay the
same before his Majesty, and to return an answer as
speedily as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>'Mr. Pitt thence went immediately to the King, and
the same evening a Cabinet Council was held at nine
o'clock, which sat until midnight; when an answer in
writing, by his Majesty's command, was dispatched by
Mr. Pitt to the Prince, informing him in general terms,
that, in case his Royal Highness thought proper to
withdraw the motion intended to be made, the next
day, in the House of Commons, everything should be
settled to his Royal Highness's satisfaction. Agreeably
to this, the motion was, the next day, withdrawn by
Alderman Newnham, as being no longer necessary;
after which, to the infinite surprise of the House, the
Minister rose up in his place, and said that he could
not see, for his own part, that the motion was then
either more or less necessary, than it ever had been;
and added, in answer to Mr. Rolle's question, that no
terms of any kind were settled, but that matters remained
<i lang="la">in statu quo</i>.</p>

<p>'This proceeding, being related to the Prince, his
Royal Highness, the same night, wrote a letter, with
his own hand, to Mr. Pitt, requiring an immediate
explanation of the extraordinary speech delivered that
day in the House of Commons. Mr. Pitt, in answer,
requested leave again to wait upon his Royal Highness.
Accordingly the Minister went on Saturday, at noon,
to Carlton House, and had another long conference
with the Prince, in which his Royal Highness (in order
to prevent any more mistakes) gave to Mr. Pitt, in
writing, his proposals, which were in substance:&mdash;1. The
Prince of Wales to have his debts paid off, in part, at
least. 2. To have a sum granted sufficient to finish
Carlton House. 3. To have such moderate increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
made to his annual income, as may be sufficient to
prevent his running in debt in future.</p>

<p>'With these propositions Mr. Pitt took his leave,
and on Sunday, despatched them by a special messenger
to Windsor, to the King; who, on Monday last, returned
his answer, signed in form by his Majesty's own
hand. This answer was on the same day delivered by
Mr. Pitt to the Prince at Carlton House, and is nearly
to the following effect:&mdash;1. That his Majesty was glad
to find the Prince of Wales ready to submit his accounts
to inspection. 2. That it would be necessary for the
Prince, not only to ascertain the whole amount of his
debts, but, also, the particulars thereof, with an exact
account of how each debt was incurred. 3. That the
Prince shall engage not to run in debt in future.
4. That, upon the specifications above required, would
depend his Majesty's determining upon whether he
should agree to the payment of the whole, or any part
of the Prince of Wales's debts. 5. That his Majesty
cannot think any increase of income necessary, so long
as the Prince of Wales shall remain unmarried. This
answer cannot be supposed to have been, in any way,
satisfactory to the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>'However, nothing was said upon the business in the
House, either on Monday, or Tuesday, and nothing on
those days was done farther than that the Prince, on
Tuesday, sent his commissioners, Colonels Lake and
Hulse, with Mr. Lyte, his Treasurer, to Mr. Pitt, with
all his accounts, etc., etc., for the inspection and information
of his Majesty.'</p>

<p>The account of the Prince's debts which was furnished
to the House is as follows:</p>

<p>On May 21 the King sent a message to the Commons,
in which he says, 'His Majesty could not, however,
expect, or desire the assistance of the House, but on a
well grounded expectation that the Prince will avoid
contracting any new debts, in future. With a view to
this object, and from an anxious desire to remove every
possible doubt of the sufficiency of the Prince's income
to support amply the dignity of his situation, his
Majesty has directed a sum of £10,000 per annum
to be paid out of his civil list, in addition to the
allowance which his Majesty has hitherto given him;
and his Majesty has the satisfaction to inform the
House that the Prince of Wales has given his Majesty
the fullest assurances of his firm determination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
confine his future expences within his income; and
has, also, settled a plan for arranging those expences
in the several departments, and for fixing an order of
payment under such regulations as his Majesty trusts
will effectually secure the due execution of the Prince's
intentions.'</p>

<p>The King's message was considered on the 24th, and
part of the Commons' reply runs thus: 'That his
Majesty may depend on the zeal and affectionate
attachment of his faithful Commons, to afford his
Majesty the assistance he desires for the discharge of
his Royal Highness's debts, and that, in full reliance
on the assurances which his Majesty has received, this
House humbly desires that his Majesty will be graciously
pleased to direct the sum of £161,000 to be issued out
of his Majesty's Civil List for that purpose, and the
sum of £20,000 on account of the works of Carlton
House, as soon as an estimate shall be formed, with
sufficient accuracy, of the whole expence for completing
the same in a proper manner, and to assure his Majesty
that his faithful Commons will make good the same.'</p>

<p>Of course there was the inevitable satirical print,
'The Prince in Clover' (June 2, 1787). The Prince
has his hands full of purses, with which he is, somewhat
theatrically, paying his creditors. Three Ministers&mdash;Pitt,
Dundas, and Thurlow&mdash;are abjectly grovelling
behind him, to the intense delight of Fox, Sheridan,
Burke and Lord North.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/b.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">BUT how about Fox's denial of the Prince's
marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? was
that to pass unnoticed? Certainly not,
and there was a slight disturbance in
Florizel's matrimonial establishment,
which may as well be told in Lord Stourton's suave
diction.</p>

<p>'The first signal interruption to this ill-fated engagement
arose from the pecuniary difficulties of his Royal
Highness, when, on the question of the payment of his
debts, Mr. Fox thought himself justified by some verbal,
or written permission of the Prince, to declare to the
House of Commons that no religious ceremony had
united the parties. This public degradation of Mrs.
Fitzherbert so compromised her character and her
religion, and irritated her feelings, that she determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to break off all connection with the Prince, and she was
only induced to receive him again into her confidence,
by repeated assurances that Mr. Fox had never been
authorised to make the declaration; and the friends of
Mrs. Fitzherbert assured her, that, in this discrepancy
as to the assertion of Mr. Fox and the Prince, she was
bound to accept the word of her husband. She informed
me that the public supported her, by their
conduct, on this occasion; for, at no period of her life,
were their visits so numerous to her house, as on the
day which followed Mr. Fox's memorable speech; and,
to use her own expression, the knocker of her door was
never still during the whole day.</p>

<p>'I told her that I understood there was a scrap of
paper from the Prince to Mr. Fox; that Sir John
Throckmorton, a friend of his, had assured me of the
fact of the Prince wishing much to obtain possession of
it; but, though written on a dirty scrap of paper, it
was much too valuable to be parted with. She said
that she rather doubted the fact. I think that the
difference between the assertions of the Prince and
Mr. Fox may be accounted for under a supposition
(which I have also heard) either that there was some
ambiguity in the expressions used, or that Mr. Fox
might have referred to what had passed, antecedently,
at Devonshire House, without being privy to their
subsequent more formal engagements.</p>

<p>'However this may be, an accommodation took place
between Mrs. Fitzherbert and the Prince, though she,
ever afterwards, resolutely refused to speak to Mr. Fox.
She was, however, obliged to see him sometimes, and
was much urged by the Prince to a reconciliation; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
though of a forgiving disposition upon other occasions,
and even benefiting some who most betrayed her confidence,
she was inflexible on this point, as it was one of
the only means left her to protect her reputation. She
thought she had been ill-used, in a most unjustifiable
manner, by this public declaration before the House of
Commons; especially as she had been waited upon by
Mr. Sheridan, who had informed her, that some explanation
would, probably, be required by Parliament, on the
subject of her connection with the Heir apparent. She
then told him, that they knew she was like a dog with a
log round its neck, and they must protect her. She
went so far with respect to Mr. Fox, that when, afterwards,
during his administration, he made overtures to
her, in order to recover her good will, she refused,
though the attainment of the rank of Duchess was to
be the fruit of their reconciliation. On naming this
circumstance to me, she observed that she did not wish
to be another Duchess of Kendal.'<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Gillray published a satirical print on May 21, 1787,
entitled 'Dido Forsaken. <i lang="la">Sic transit gloria Reginæ.</i>'
Mrs. Fitzherbert, crucifix in hand, is seated on a heap
of ruins, in utter despair, whilst a breeze, blown by Pitt
and Dundas, carries away her crown, orb, sceptre, and
coronet, as Princess of Wales. In a boat named <em>Honor</em>,
bound for Windsor, sail away the Prince, Fox (who
steers), Lord North, and Burke. The Prince says, 'I
never saw her in my life.' Fox clinches this with, 'No,
never in his life, Damme.' North and Burke asseverate
'No, never.' On the ground lie fetters, an axe, rods,
and a harrow, 'for the conversion of heretics,' being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
delicate allusion to Mrs. Fitzherbert being a Roman
Catholic.</p>

<p>However, the difference between the couple was made
up, and they were in Brighton together early in July.
The Prince evidently used some of his newly-got money
on his seaside residence, for we read in the <cite>Morning
Herald</cite> for July 3, 1787: 'Last Tuesday morning
(26 June) as the painters were beautifying the great
dome of the Prince of Wales's house at Brighthelmstone,
the scaffolding broke down, whereby several of
the workmen were killed, and others terribly wounded.
His Royal Highness has caused enquiry to be made
into the condition of their families, in order to give
them relief.'</p>

<p>We hear very little of his stay at Brighton during
this year. The <cite>Morning Herald</cite> of July 24 tells us:
'The <em>Prince</em>, we are happy to say, has derived much
benefit from the air of Brighthelmstone, and the exercise
which he has taken in its environs. We have never
seen his <em>Royal Highness</em> in better health, or more
apparent spirits than in his evening walks on the
Steyne. His companions in these promenades, exclusive
of the gentlemen of his suite, are, in general,
Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;, with the Countess of Talbot, and Lady
Stawell.'</p>

<p>In the same newspaper of August 6, we find under
the heading '<span class="smcap">Brighthelmstone</span>, Aug. 3. This scene
feels, at present, a temporary desertion from the general
resort of the visitants to the races of Lewes. The
Prince has also left it this morning, on hearing of the
arrival of his brother, the Duke of York, from the
Continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>'The races above mentioned derived more celebrity
from the brilliant attendance with which they were
honoured, than from the sport which they afforded.
The betting on the first day was so generally on the
side of <em>Marplot</em> that eighty guineas to sixty, and
immediately before starting sixty to forty were offered
and refused. Mr. Fox took the odds that were offered
against <em>Balloon</em>, to the amount of about five hundred
pounds, and Mr. Tetherington is said to have cleared
upwards of a thousand by the success of his horse
<em>Marplot</em>.</p>

<p>'Amongst those present were the Prince, the Duke
and Duchess of Cumberland, the Princesse de Lamballe,
who was particularly distinguished through the day by
the <em>enviable</em> attentions of the Duke of Queensberry.
The Duchess of Rutland, the Countess of Talbot, Lord
and Lady Abergavenny, Mrs. Fitzherbert, Lord Clermont,
Lord Grosvenor, Sir John Lade, Sir Richard
Heron, Mr. Fox, Mr. Wyndham, Mr. Pelham, Col.
Fitzpatrick, etc., added to the fashion of the group.</p>

<p>'After the first race, the Prince, with a select party,
retired to partake of an entertainment provided for
them at the seat of Mr. Wyndham, near Lewes.'</p>

<p>In 1788 the Prince went to Brighton for the season
on July 1, and very shortly, when driving with Mrs.
Fitzherbert, they were both upset. Neither could have
been much hurt, for the <cite>Morning Post</cite> of July 5 says
that the Prince came to town the previous day, and
that 'Mrs. Fitzherbert is totally recovered from the
effects of her accident.' Still, this trivial event gave
food to the caricaturist, 'The Prince's Disaster, or a
fall in Fitz.' They have been for a drive in an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
carriage, which has broken down. Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; lies on
the ground, and the Prince is being thrown out.</p>

<p>That their mutual relations were cordial is evidenced
by a satirical print, April 3, 1788, where Mrs. Fitzherbert
is seen leading the Prince in chains. She says,
'Who can behold without transport "the glass of
fashion and the mould of form, the observ'd of all
observers," smiling in chains?' He replies, 'Delightful
slavery! A day, an hour, of such sweet bondage is
worth an eternity of celestial happiness!'</p>

<p>We get a glimpse of what Brighton was, at this time,
by the two following newspaper cuttings. <cite>Morning
Post</cite>, July 14: 'Brighton, with the Prince, and such
Company as follow the Prince, will do very well, though,
of late years, it has not been so crowded as formerly.
Many reasons have been assigned for this change&mdash;we,
however, for <em>propriety's sake</em>, shall give none.' <i>Ibid.</i>,
July 21: 'Brighton, notwithstanding the return of the
Prince, does not bear the appearance of pleasure and
fashion.'</p>

<p>And it can hardly be wondered at, for the Prince
had relapsed, since he had got his debts paid, and kept
very bad company. He always was fond of seeing
prize-fights, and he and the Duc d'Orleans saw the
fight between Humphries and Martin at Newmarket,
on May 3, 1786; but he had more than he bargained
for at Brighton Races this year. The event is thus
recorded in <cite>Boxiana</cite> (vol. i., p. 219, ed. 1818): '<em>Tyne</em>
next entered the lists with <em>Earl</em>, upon a stage erected
near the stand on the Brighton Race ground, on
August 6, 1788. Never were more fashionables assembled
at a boxing match than the above; the town of Bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>helmstone
was literally drained of its company, and the
race stand was crowded to excess with nobility and gentry;
among whom was his Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales. <em>Earl</em> was a tall, strong man, and, in point of
appearance, the favourite, and was actually becoming
so from his exertions, when <em>Tyne</em> put in a blow upon
his temple, that made him reel against the rail of the
stage, and he instantly dropped down dead: which
unfortunate circumstance produced a most afflicting
scene; and the Prince declared he would never witness
another battle. His Royal Highness, with great
humanity and consideration, settled an annuity on
Mrs. <em>Earl</em> and family. It appeared by the evidence
before the Coroner's jury that <em>Earl</em> had been for some
time previous to the battle engaged in an election
contest at Covent Garden, and had been in one continued
state of inebriety during the whole of it. It
was the opinion of professional men, that the vessels
being so overcharged with blood was the immediate
cause of his death.'</p>

<p>The <cite>Morning Post</cite> of August 9 has the following
from Brighton: 'The Prince of Wales gains many
hearts by his great affability and good humour. His
company is much better than it used to be, and he is
certainly more sparing of his libations to Bacchus.</p>

<p>'Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;t looks more elegant than ever. One
can, indeed, hardly help exclaiming with the army of
Mahomet the Second, when he showed them his Irene&mdash;"Such
a woman is worth a kingdom!"</p>

<p>'The Prince of Wales has won money on the races&mdash;more
money than one would wish a Prince of Wales
to win.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The same newspaper of August 15 says: <span class="smcap">Brighthelmstone</span>.&mdash;The
celebration of the Prince's birthday
was in a style of the utmost gaiety and conviviality, the
more general and uniform, from the contracted circle in
which it shone. The Prince gave a most sumptuous
entertainment at the <span class="smcap">Marine Pavilion</span>,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of which all
the Nobility and Gentry in the town and neighbourhood
partook by invitation. In the evening the illuminations
were general, and some of them conspicuous
for taste, particularly the Castle, the front of which
was covered with various coloured lamps. A Ball was
given by the Jockey Club, in honour of the Prince, who
honoured several ladies with his hand during the course
of the evening.'</p>

<p><i>Ibid.</i>, <i>September 6.</i>&mdash;'The Prince of Wales does not
slumber in dull indolence at his retreat at Brighton,
but promotes and participates in many manly exercises.
Cricket is, at present, the chief amusement patronized
by his Royal Highness, who is dexterous and indefatigable.
Most of the young noblemen in the neighbourhood
join in this vigorous and wholesome exercise,
in which the domestics of the Prince are permitted to
partake.'</p>

<p>We get a good glimpse of our great grandfathers
and grandmothers at Brighton in the <cite>Morning Post</cite> of
September 18: '<span class="smcap">Dress at Brighton</span>.&mdash;The fashionable
bathing dress at Brighton is chiefly a pair of buff
trousers, and a slight jacket.</p>

<p>'This is adopted by all the young men of the place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and such a number of idle, sauntering <em>land lubbers</em>
meet the eye, every morning, on the Steyne, that one
cannot help wishing for a sturdy press gang to give
them useful employment, or, at least, keep them out of
mischief.</p>

<p>'After breakfast, they are then accoutred for the
sports of the field.</p>

<p>'The sporting dress is a brown jacket, with a multiplicity
of pockets on each side, that reach from the
bottom to the top, so that, from this appearance, it is
somewhat difficult to determine which the fashionable
tribe most resemble, a set of <em>grooms</em>, or a company of
<em>smugglers</em>.</p>

<p>'When the dinner hour arrives, after these sprightly
and heroic gentlemen have <em>slain their thousands and ten
thousands</em>, according to their own account, in the field,
with as little winking and blinking as <em>Major Sturgeon</em>
himself, they then attire themselves in order to enjoy
the pleasures of the table; and, however deranged they
may, afterwards, be by convivial excess, they march,
or stagger away to the <em>Rooms</em>, as circumstances may
determine, and entertain the Ladies with <em>elegant</em> and
<em>decent</em> gallantry.</p>

<p>'The Ladies have no particular dress for the morning,
but huddle away to the bathing-place, in close caps and
gipsy bonnets, so that they look like a set of wandering
<em>fortune tellers</em>, who have just had the opportunity of
pillaging the contents of a <em>frippery warehouse</em>, with
which they have bedecked themselves in haste.</p>

<p>'It is to be remarked that the Ladies do not atone
for the negligence of the morning, by neatness and
elegance during the rest of the day, but <em>shuffle</em> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<em>something</em> by dinner time, covering themselves with an
enormous nondescript bonnet, which, to the confusion
of all order, they, afterwards, think a proper garb for
the assembly.</p>

<p>'If a spectator, not cognizant in the fanciful and
capricious variations of <em>ton</em>, were to cast his eyes on the
motley groupe contained in the Rooms, of an evening;
far from supposing them persons of the first fashion
attired for a Ball, he would consider them as a band of
<em>Bedlamites</em>; or, at best, conclude that the whole presented
the extravagant vagaries of a Masquerade.'</p>

<p>This year Mrs. Fitzherbert moved into a house in
Pall Mall, which had a private entrance into the grounds
of Carlton House. There was a question put in the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> of October 10 which was never answered.
'<span class="smcap">A Question</span>, What is the reason that Mrs. <span class="smcap">Fitzherbert</span>,
who is a lady of fortune and fashion, never appears at
Court? She is visited by <em>some</em> ladies of high rank&mdash;has
been in public with them&mdash;and, yet, never goes to
the Drawing Rooms at St. James's. This question is
sent for publication by a person who pays no regard
to the idle reports of the day, and wishes to have the
mystery cleared up.'</p>

<p>The house which Weltje had taken for His Royal
Highness had the Castle Tavern on one side of its
grounds, and Grove House on the other, and considerable
alterations were made in it since it was leased to
Weltje from Mr. Kempe for £150 per annum with the
option of purchase (which was exercised) for £3,000,
and the house and gardens were leased by Weltje to the
Prince for a term of twenty-one years from Christmas,
1787.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>When the King was taken ill with his first attack of
mental aberration, in November, 1788, the Prince and
Mrs. Fitzherbert came up to London, a fact which the
pictorial satirist soon got hold of; and a print was
published in that month, in which the King was depicted
as being in bed, a Bishop reading prayers for his restoration
to health. This solemn group is interrupted by
the Prince of Wales bursting into the room, calling out,
'Damme, come along, I'll see if the old fellow's &mdash;&mdash; or
not!' Following him are George Hanger, with a bottle,
and Sheridan. To point this satire the more, a picture
of the Prodigal Son hangs on the wall.</p>

<p>Miss Burney gives us an account of the King's seizure
and of the arrival of the Prince, and although his conduct
was not as heartless as shown in the etching, it was
bad enough. 'Soon after, suddenly arrived the Prince
of Wales. He came into the room. He had just
quitted Brighthelmstone. Something passing within
seemed to render this meeting awfully distant on both
sides. She (the Queen) asked him if he should not
return to Brighthelmstone. He answered, yes, the
next day.'</p>

<p>But this he did not do, as there were already rumours
of a Regency, yet his conduct towards his father seems
to have been very bad. Grenville, writing to his brother,
the Duke of Buckingham, November 23, 1788, says:
'Think of the Prince of Wales introducing Lord Lothian
into the King's room when it was darkened, in order that
he might hear his ravings at the time that they were
at the worst. Do not let this fact come from you; it
begins to be pretty well known here, and, no doubt,
will find its way to Ireland; but it is important that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
we should not seem to spread the knowledge of anything
which can injure his Royal Highness's character in public
opinion.'<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>There was much intriguing as to a Regency, the
Ministry at first suggesting that the Government should
be carried on by a Commission; but on December 30,
1788, Pitt wrote a letter to the Prince of Wales, stating
that His Majesty's Ministers had come to the conclusion
to offer him the Regency of the kingdom, under certain
restrictions.</p>

<p>The Prince replied at once, expressing his sorrow at
the occasion of his proposed elevation, but accepting
the trust. Of course, this suggestion of the Government
could not be acted upon without mature deliberation,
and it was not until January 30, 1789, that the
following resolutions of the Lords and Commons were
presented to the Prince of Wales: 'That his Royal
Highness be empowered to exercise the Royal authority
under the title of Regent.'&mdash;'That the power given,
should not extend to the granting of any Peerage,
except to the Royal issue.'&mdash;'Nor to the grant of any
office in reversion, or any office, salary, or pension,
than during his Majesty's pleasure; or to the granting
his Majesty's real, or personal estates.'&mdash;'That the
care of his Majesty be committed to the Queen, who
should nominate all persons to the offices in the household.'</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Prince made no objections, and
by February 12 the Regency Bill had gone through all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
its stages in the House of Commons, and was ordered
to be sent to the Lords. But the proverbial 'slip 'twixt
cup and lip' occurred. On February 19 the Lord
Chancellor informed the House of Lords that, according
to the report of his physicians, the King's health
was steadily mending, and they therefore abstained
from further consideration of the Regency Bill.</p>

<p>The physicians' hopes were fully justified; the King
got better rapidly, and on February 27 his perfect
recovery was announced, the prayer for the same was
discontinued, and a form of prayer of thanksgiving for
his restoration to health was ordered to be read in all
churches and chapels throughout England and Wales.
Rejoicings and illuminations were the order of the day,
and on April 23, the day of general thanksgiving, the
King, Queen, and Royal Family went in state to St.
Paul's Cathedral, to return thanks to God for His
mercy in giving the King his health and reason once
again.</p>

<p>Naturally, there were satirical prints going about,
but not so many as might be thought. There was one
in February, 1789, called 'The Rival Queens. <i>A Political
Heat for Lege and Grege.</i>' Madame Schwellenburg,
the Queen's Mistress of the Robes, armed with the Lord
Chancellor's mace, is making a desperate onslaught on
Mrs. Fitzherbert, who defends herself with a crucifix.
Pitt officiates as second to the German lady, and Florizel
performs the same office towards his wife.</p>

<p>On April 29 appeared 'The Funeral Procession of
Miss Regency,' in which are numerous figures. On the
coffin are a dice-box and two dice, the Prince of Wales's
coronet, and an empty purse. The chief mourner is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Mrs. Fitzherbert, who is in deep grief at the loss of her
position. Of course Fox and Sheridan are among the
mourners, as are also the Prince's household, amongst
whom is the 'Clerk of the Dish Clouts,' Weltje, who
laments:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The King being ordered to Weymouth, the
Prince left, early in July, for Brighton.
We do not hear much of him there, and
more of what we read is pleasant. Fitzgerald<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
says: 'On one of the evenings
at the Pavilion (one of Sir P. Francis's daughters reports)
his Royal Highness, after dinner, having proposed
music, and being actively engaged in performing, with
Mr. Francis and some other person, the pretty hunting
trio of "Azioli," of which the burden is <i lang="it">Ritorneremo a
Clori</i>. But the story is amusing, and bears such a
favourable testimony to the Prince's good humour, that
the lady must be allowed to tell it herself.</p>

<p>'"It is well known that, to an excessive love of
music, he added much real taste as an amateur, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
some power as a performer; but his execution was not
particularly good, and Mr. Francis, Sir Philip's son,
with whom he frequently sang, was, sometimes, comically
struck by the loudness of his voice, and his peculiar
manner. On one of the above-mentioned evenings at
the Pavilion, his Royal Highness, after dinner, having
proposed music, and being actually engaged in performing
with Mr. Francis and some other person the
pretty hunting trio of 'Azioli,' of which the burden
is <i lang="it">Ritorneremo a Clori al tramontar del di</i>, Mr. Francis
suddenly found the full face of the Prince, somewhat
heated by the eagerness of his performance, in immediate
contact with his own; and this circumstance,
combined with that of the loud bass tones in which
his Royal Highness was singing the words <i lang="it">Ritorneremo
a Clori</i>, striking him in some ludicrous point of view,
he became absolutely unable to resist the effect on his
nerves, and burst out laughing. The Prince evidently
perceived that his own singing had produced the unseasonable
laughter; but, instead of showing a displeasure
at a rudeness which, however involuntary,
would have been resented by many far less illustrious
persons, he only called the offender to order with the
words 'Come, come, Philip!' his countenance betraying,
at the same time, a strong inclination to join in
the laugh himself; and the trio proceeded to a conclusion.
Sir Philip (adds his daughter) by his original
humour, and great powers of conversation, was, often,
the life of the Pavilion; though his temperate habits
made the excesses occasionally committed at the Prince's
table distasteful to him; and his royal host, perceiving
him ready to drop asleep when the revels were long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
protracted, would say, 'We must carry grandpapa
away to bed.'"'</p>

<p>The same ready good humour is shown in a
pleasant scene which took place at the Pavilion.
Cricket was often played on the lawn, and the dinner
which followed was served in a marquee. On one of
these occasions the Duke of York and Sheridan fell
into dispute on some point of the game. Sheridan at
length angrily told the Duke 'that he was not to be
talked out of his opinion there, or anywhere else; and
that, at play, all men were on a par.' The Duke
was evidently about to make some peculiarly indignant
reply, when the Prince stood up and addressed them
both.</p>

<p>Dr. Croly, in his 'Life of George IV.,' tells the
remainder of the story: 'The narrator of the circumstance,
a person of rank, who was present, himself one
of the most attractive public speakers of the day, has
often declared that he never, on any occasion, saw any
individual, under the circumstances, acquit himself with
more ability. The speech was of some length&mdash;ten or
fifteen minutes; it was alternately playful and grave,
expressed with perfect self-possession, and touching on
the occurrence of the game, the characters of both
disputants, and the conversation at the table, with the
happiest delicacy and dexterity. Among other points,
the Prince made a laughing apology for Sheridan's use
of the phrase "on a par," by bidding his brother remember
that the impressions of school were not easily
effaced; that Dr. Parr had inflicted learning upon
Sheridan; and that, like the lover in <em>The Wonder</em>,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
who mixes his mistress's name with everything, and
calls to his valet, "Roast me these Violantes," the
name of Parr was uppermost in Sheridan's sleep: he
then ran into a succession of sportive quotations of the
word <i lang="la">par</i>, in the style of <i lang="la">Ludere par impar, equitare
in arundina longâ</i>, until the speech was concluded in
general gaiety, and the dispute was thought of no
more.'</p>

<p>The rupture between the Prince and his father was
complete, the Prince refusing to visit him while he was
stopping at Weymouth, but sending the Duke of York
instead; he pursued his course of folly at Brighton,
where Fox visited him, and they went to Lewes Races,
where the Prince was received by the High Sheriff of
the county, attended by a host of javelin men. Three
ladies were conspicuous at these races for their equipages,
each drawn by four gray ponies&mdash;Mrs. Fitzherbert, the
Duchess of Rutland, and Lady Lade.</p>

<p>This latter was no fit companion for any decent
woman. The first heard of her was in St. Giles's, where
she was said to be the mistress of Jack Rann, commonly
known as Sixteen String Jack, a highwayman, who was
executed in 1774. She married Sir John Lade, a boon
companion of the Prince, and his tutor in the art of
driving. She was famous for her bad language and
skill in riding and driving. Of her the following lines
were written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">'More than one steed Letitia's empire feels,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">Who sits triumphant o'er the flying wheels;<br /></div>
<div class="verse">And, as she guides them through th' admiring throng,<br /></div>

<div class="verse">Sesostris like, such charioteers as these,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">May drive six harness'd monarchs, if they please.'<br /></div>
</div></div>

<p>Sir John Lade, of Haremere, was a mere country
squire who, when he came of age, inherited a fair
fortune, which he soon dissipated. Mrs. Thrale was
his guardian, and it was when he attained his majority
in 1780 that Dr. Johnson wrote the following prophetic
verses:</p>

<p>He kept race-horses, and lost. He gambled and
betted on anything. One of his bets is somewhat
amusing. It is in the <cite>Times</cite> of October 2, 1795: 'A
curious circumstance occurred here (Brighton) yesterday.
Sir <span class="smcap">John Lade</span>, for a trifling wager, undertook to carry
Lord <span class="smcap">Cholmondely</span>, on <em>his back</em>, from opposite the
Pavilion, twice round the Steine. Several ladies attended
to be the spectators of this extraordinary feat of the
dwarf carrying a giant. When his Lordship declared
himself ready, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span> desired him to <span class="smcap">STRIP</span>. "Strip!"
exclaimed the other: "why, surely you promised to
carry me in my clothes!" "By no means," exclaimed
the Baronet. "I engaged to carry <em>you</em>, but not an
inch of clothes. So, therefore, my Lord, make ready,
and let us not <em>disappoint</em> the ladies." After much
laughable altercation, it was, at length, decided that
Sir <span class="smcap">John</span> had won his wager, the Peer declining to
exhibit <i lang="la">in puris naturalibus</i>.'</p>

<p>When he got poor, I presume the Prince cut him,
for he ended his days as groom and coachman to the
Earl of Anglesey.</p>

<p>The two following paragraphs from the <cite>St. James's
Chronicle</cite> for 1789 tell us something about the Prince's
doings at Brighton:</p>

<p><i>August 13-15.</i>&mdash;'The Prince of Wales's birthday,
on Thursday, was very splendidly celebrated at Brighthelmstone.&mdash;<em>St.
George</em>, the famous fencing master,
exhibited several trials of his skill, with two French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
masters, before the Prince and a large company, in a
pavilion and marquees pitched about a mile from the
town: an ox was roasted whole, and given to the
populace. The Duke of Clarence gave prizes to several
sailing boats, which afforded much diversion&mdash;the
company dined in the pavilion, and the evening concluded
with a supper and ball at the Castle Inn, given
by the Dukes of York and Clarence.&mdash;The illuminations
were universal and elegant.'</p>

<p><i>September 5-8.</i>&mdash;'The foundation for the Prince's dog-kennel
was laid, last week, in the <em>North fields</em> near
Brighton.&mdash;Six or seven acres of these fields are to be
inclosed as a paddock, with the building in the centre,
which is to be finished in a month.'</p>

<p>Yes, the repentant prodigal had forgotten all his
promises of never again running into debt. He was
deeply dipped, and yet he kept altering his 'Marine
Pavilion,' and now was building most expensive stables.
He tried to borrow money on post-obits, and Weltje
was the go-between with the money-lenders. A
Mr. Cator lent £10,000 on condition of being repaid
treble the amount, and about £30,000 was raised in
£100 bonds, repayable in twelve years, which bonds
were signed by the Prince, the Duke of York, and
Prince William. They then tried to raise about
£350,000 abroad on the security of the Duchy of
Cornwall and the Bishopric of Osnaburg, and it is said
they received over £100,000 in cash and jewels; but
the story of this loan is a long one, and does not come
within the scope of this book.</p>

<p>Here is a story of his dealings with his jeweller
Jefferys, whom he eventually ruined by not paying him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
told by himself.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He was appointed jeweller to the
Prince in 1788 or 1789.</p>

<p>'About the period to which I allude, the Prince of
Wales (upon Mr. Gray<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> requiring a settlement of the
great demands he had upon his Royal Highness) was
so much displeased at that circumstance, as to cease
giving him farther employment. His Royal Highness
then sent for me to Carlton House, and conferred upon
me (most unfortunately) the favour which he had withdrawn
from Mr. Gray. From this time, not a day
passed, for several years, in which, neglecting any
general business, I did not spend half my time at
Carlton House; and in which some entries were not
made in my books of large amounts for goods sold to
his Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'On the twenty eighth day of January, One Thousand
Seven Hundred and Ninety, the Prince of Wales sent
for me to Carlton House, at a much earlier hour in the
morning than he was accustomed to do; and, taking
me into an inner apartment, with very visible marks
of agitation in his countenance and manner, said, he
had a great favour to ask of me, which, if I could
accomplish, would be doing him the greatest service,
and he should ever consider it accordingly. I replied,
that I feared what his Royal Highness might consider
a great favour done towards him, must be more than
my limited means could accomplish; but, in all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
I could do, I was entirely at his service, and requested
his Royal Highness to name his commands.</p>

<p>'His Royal Highness then proceeded to state, that
a creditor of Mrs. Fitzherbert had made a very
peremptory demand for the payment of about sixteen
hundred pounds: that Mr. Weltje had been sent by
his Royal Highness to the creditor making such demand,
to desire that it might be placed to the Prince's account:
this, the creditor refused to do, on the ground that
Mrs. Fitzherbert, <em>being a woman of no rank, or consideration,
in the eye of the law, as to personal privilege,
was amenable to an immediate process</em>, which was not
the case with his Royal Highness. This, the Prince
stated, to have caused in his mind the greatest uneasiness,
for fear of the consequences that might ensue;
as it was not in the power of his Royal Highness to
pay the money then, or to name an earlier period for
so doing than three or four months. The request,
therefore, that his Royal Highness had to make to me
was, that I would interfere upon the occasion, and
prevent, if possible, any personal inconvenience to
Mrs. Fitzherbert, which would be attended with extreme
mortification to the feelings of his Royal Highness.</p>

<p>'I assured his Royal Highness that I would do all I
could in the business; and I was appointed to attend,
with the result of my endeavours, at Carlton House,
the next morning. I did attend, as appointed, and
presented the Prince of Wales with a receipt for the
whole sum:&mdash;<em>fifteen hundred and eighty-five pounds,
eleven shillings, and sevenpence, which I had, that
morning, paid, being the only effectual means of pacifying
the creditor, and removing from the mind of his Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Highness, the anxiety he appeared so strongly to labor
under</em>.</p>

<p>'His Royal Highness was unbounded in his expressions
of satisfaction at what I had so promptly accomplished,
and in his assurances of future support, a
support so strongly made, and so frequently repeated,
as well as accompanied with such <em>apparent</em> marks of
sincerity, as to have fixed my faith, (even had it been
wavering) in the entire confidence I might place in all
his promises and assurances.</p>

<p>'But what will the world think, or say, when I inform
them, that in ten long years of the most bitter adversity,
occasioned by a continuance of similar confidence, I
have repeatedly applied, in vain, to his Royal Highness
for relief, even in any degree to which he might have
been induced, or enabled to have afforded it me, but
he has ever been deaf to my entreaties.</p>

<p>'The moment misfortune overtook me, the Prince
of Wales totally deserted me; and my services, and his
promises, were then alike forgotten.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'In the afternoon of the same day on which I had
so highly gratified the Prince, and heard from his lips
such kind expressions of regard; the Prince of Wales
came to my house, in Piccadilly, and brought with him,
Mrs. Fitzherbert, for the express purpose, as His Royal
Highness condescendingly said, that she might, herself,
thank me for the great and essential service I had, that
morning, rendered to her, by the relief my exertions
had produced on the minds of his Royal Highness and
Mrs. Fitzherbert. And his Royal Highness continued
to repeat the same expressions of satisfaction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
assurances of support, which he had so abundantly
made use of, in the former part of the day.'</p>

<p>Huish<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> is responsible for the following: 'The person
of Mrs. Fitzherbert was, one morning, taken in execution
for a debt of £1,825, <em>the Prince of Wales being in
the house at the time</em>. The writ being returnable on the
morrow, and no bail being available, the money must
be paid, or the lady conveyed to prison. The Prince
lost not a moment in making the application to his
customary resources, but they appeared to be, most
unaccountably, hermetically closed against him. In
some instances, the most shallow excuses were returned;
in others, the impossibility of supplying so large a sum
on so short a notice; all of which the Prince knew to
be false, and, therefore, he began, justly, to suspect that
there was some secret machinery at work to prevent the
necessary supplies from being advanced.</p>

<p>'In this emergency, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;l was despatched to an
eminent pawnbroker in Fleet Street, who at that time
was in the habit of lending large sums of money to the
nobility, on their plate and jewels, and who was the
actual holder of the celebrated jewels of the Duchess of
Devonshire, the publicity of which hurried her prematurely
to the grave. On the present occasion, Mr.
Parker, the pawnbroker, lost no time in repairing to
Park Lane, where the unfortunate lady was in the
custody of the sheriff's officers; and, here, a new
difficulty presented itself in the way of her emancipation.
The harpies of the law objected to any part of
the plate or jewels being deposited in the hands of
Mr. Parker, until their demand was satisfied. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
other hand, the wily pawnbroker refused to advance the
money until the property was placed in his hands, as he
did not know but what there might be other actions in
reserve, for the liquidation of which the property in
the house might prove inadequate. Under these
circumstances, C&mdash;&mdash;l was secretly despatched to Carlton
House, with instructions to bring away with him a
particular casket, which contained the Prince's state
jewels, which, although exceeding in value ten times
the amount of the sum which he had to pay, was borne
away by the pawnbroker to his depository in Fleet
Street, but which, however, was redeemed on the following
day by an advance which the Prince obtained from
the wealthy Jew in St. Mary Axe.'</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FROM the pencil of Rowlandson the caricaturist,
who with his friend Wigstead,
a Bow Street magistrate, went a trip to
Brighton in 1789, we have an excellent
picture of the Pavilion, as it then was,
and a view of the Steyne.</p>

<p>Their opinion of the building is that 'the <i lang="fr">tout
ensemble</i> is, in short, perfect Harmony. The whole was
executed by Mr. Holland, under the immediate inspection
and Direction of Mr. Weltjie, whose Attachment
to his Royal Master was faithful and disinterested.'
In the same book Rowlandson gives us a sketch of the
beach at Brighton at the same period.</p>

<p>On July 23, 1790, the Prince went to Brighton for
the season, being preceded by a day or two by the Duke
of York, and his birthday was kept on August 17 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>

<p>It was in this year that one of the Prince's boon companions,
Richard Barry, seventh Lord Barrymore, made
himself somewhat notorious at Brighton. He had just
come of age, and into a fortune of £20,000 a year, of
which he tried to make ducks and drakes as quickly
as possible, especially on the turf. A characteristic
anecdote of him is related in the <cite>Sussex Weekly
Advertiser</cite>, of June 21, 1790: 'Lord Barrymore had
his watch taken from him at Ascot Heath races. He
missed it immediately, and followed the fellow, who
stopped, and entered into conversation with a well-known
<em>boxer</em>. As soon as the conversation between
these <em>gentlemen</em> ended, his Lordship went to the
<em>champion of the fist</em>, and took his watch. The latter
expostulating, Lord Barrymore informed him that his
<em>friend</em> had just taken his watch, and that, if he would
recover it, he should have his own. The <em>Knight of the
Knuckle</em> soon regained his Lordship's watch from the
pupil of <em>Barrington</em>, and retrieved his own.'</p>

<p>In compliment to his manners and language, his
lordship was generally known as <em>Hell-gate</em>; his next
brother, the Hon. and Rev. Augustus Barry, was called
<em>Newgate</em>, because he had been 'in prisons oft'; and their
younger brother, the Hon. Henry Barry,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> <em>Cripple-gate</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
because of some physical deformity. To complete this
delightful family, there was a sister, who from her
habit of swearing was called <em>Billings-gate</em>.</p>

<p>We read in the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite>, July 29-31,
1790: 'A pugilistick <i lang="fr">rencontre</i> took place, a few days
since, at Brighton, between Lord Barrymore and young
Fox, son to the manager of the Theatre, in which the
conduct of some of the parties is represented as very
little to their credit.' The <cite>Sussex Weekly Advertiser</cite>,
August 2, says: 'The Rencounter which took place on
the Steine at Brighton, on Monday evening last, and
the cause of it have been grossly misrepresented in the
London papers; they were set out with the wrong day:
but, as Lord Barrymore has, through the goodness of
the Prince, forgiven the insult he received, we shall not
revive it by a relation of its attendant circumstances.'</p>

<p>The caricaturist soon caught hold of it, and we have
'<span class="smcap">Scrub</span> and <span class="smcap">Boniface</span>, or, Three Brave Lads, against
one poor Roscius&mdash;London, pub. Aug. 9 by Steine
Briton, Newgate Inv<sup>t</sup>, Cripple-gate Direxit, Hell-gate
Fecit.' Mr. Fox, son to the manager of the Brighton
theatre is on the ground, calling out, 'Foul, foul.' The
Earl of Barrymore is still raining blows upon him, and
kicking him, encouraged by his two brothers, one of
whom says, 'B&mdash;&mdash;t me, I'll lay 3 to 1 we lick him.'
The other calls out, 'Bloody Newgate to me, if I don't
take his father's licence.' Sheridan deprecates with,
'Dam it, Newgate, fight like a man, no kicking.' The
Duke of York, looking on, thus alludes to his duel with
Colonel Lenox, 'Fie donc&mdash;If he had hit my head, instead
of my curl, I would have fought fair.'</p>

<p><cite>The World</cite> of August 2, 1790, says: 'A report was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
circulated in town, that it was <span class="smcap">Charles Fox</span>, and not
the Manager's Son, who fought Lord Barrymore at
Brighton. The report gained credit from the addition
that the parties, immediately after the battle, <em>coalesced</em>.'</p>

<p>But fisticuffs were fashionable, <i lang="la">vide</i> the <cite>Sussex Weekly
Advertiser</cite> of August 9, 1790: 'Between the heats, on
Saturday, a Boxing Match took place between a young
man of this town, and one of the <em>black legged society</em>;
which, after a contest of about half an hour, terminated
in favour of the latter. The number of spectators, we
should think, were not less than 2,000.</p>

<p>'In making the ring, several scuffles ensued, that had
like to have produced more battles. Captain Aston,
who, lately, fought a duel, was with difficulty prevented
in engaging in a conflict of the knuckle.</p>

<p>'One gentleman, who had struck a youth, as was
supposed by some others that saw it, without provocation,
was set upon, and had his shirt almost torn from
his back.</p>

<p>'We could but both admire and applaud the singular
good humour of the Duke of York, during the above
battle. His Royal Highness, with a degree of freedom
and politeness that might not have been expected even
from a private gentleman, permitted <em>any one who chose
it</em>, to take the benefit of his lofty Phaeton to see the
fight, and actually accommodated, in, upon, and about
it, near 30 persons, himself holding the reins, and
observing the utmost care that the horses did not move
forward, to endanger their lives and limbs, as on that,
alone, depended the safety of many, who, either to
gratify their Broughtonian curiosity, or ambitious
desire to partake of so much of the Royal favour, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
placed themselves on the wheels and every other part of
the carriage, till it was completely covered.</p>

<p>'On the race-ground, on Saturday, Mr. Beeby, of
Ringmer, near this town, feeling himself affronted at
some words spoken by Lord Barrymore, told his Lordship,
he should, in consequence, expect to see him the
next morning. But an explanation, we hear, afterwards
took place, and the matter was amicably adjusted;
the offensive words not being directed to Mr. Beeby.'</p>

<p>Here is another of his fights recorded in the same
paper of September 19, 1791: 'A circumstance occurred,
last week, near the Steine at Brighton, that precipitated
Lord Barrymore and Mr. Donadieu, a perfumer, in
London, into a pugilistic encounter; but his Lordship,
after a few rounds, being likely to obtain no advantage
in single combat, an interference ensued, that soon
brought Mr. Donadieu into a situation so perilous, that
he summoned the assistance of the spectators by the
cry of <em>murder</em>, which so operated on the humanity of a
young man, a linen draper, present, that he remonstrated
on the violence offered to Mr. D., and, in consequence,
got very roughly handled. The matter, we hear, has
since been compromised with the perfumer to his satisfaction.
But the linen draper, we understand, is seeking
redress through the medium of the law.' There is
another paragraph in the next week's paper, confirming
the intention of the linen-draper to go to law.</p>

<p>The same newspaper of September 26 gives the
following story, which has been universally credited to
Lord Barrymore: 'A coffin has been borne about by
men, through the streets of Brighton, for several evenings,
in dismal annoyance to the peaceable inhabitant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and valetudinarian visitant. The <em>Merry Mourners</em> happened,
unfortunately, to call at one, among many other
houses, where pregnancy gave a natural increase of
sensibility to the nerves of a poor woman, who opened
the door at their wanton summons, and, soon after, by
miscarriage, produced a premature candidate for a coffin,
in melancholy earnest. An Italian, who, having heard,
or, perhaps read, that Thespis, daubed with wine lees,
squeaked his satire from a cart, got into this comic
coffin, in order to <em>grin</em> a death's head moral to mortality.
When his horizontal site got tiresome, Signor Cataletto
resigned in favour of another, a dependent of the same
household, who was conveyed in the coffin to the churchyard,
whither, by consent between the parties, one of
them, soon after, conducted a fair companion. On
taking their stand near the coffin, Master <em>Dead-alive</em>
rose, and sat up therein. The affrighted <em>Rep</em>, thinking
it was some ghost which rose to avenge the profanation
intended, scoured over the tombs with the pace of
<em>Camilla</em>. Mr. O. a gentleman, having been honoured,
one evening, with a visit by this drear procession, sallied
out with a brace of pistols. They fled&mdash;but the bearers
were, at last, obliged to drop their sable burden. The
spirited pursuer soon brought the cased menial to own,
that though so confined, he was yet alive, and belonged
to the Wargrave<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> family.'</p>

<p>One who knew him well thus describes him: 'His
Lordship was alternately between the gentleman and
the black guard, the refined wit and the most vulgar
bully were equally well known in St. James's and St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Giles's. He could fence, dance, drive, or drink, box, or
bet with any man in the kingdom. He could discourse
slang as trippingly as French, relish porter after port,
and compliment her ladyship, at a ball, with as much
ease and brilliance, as he could bespatter in blood in a
cider cellar.'</p>

<p>Henry Angelo,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the fencing master, tells many anecdotes
of him; and, as he was very frequently in his
company, owing to their mutual taste for amateur
theatricals, they may be taken as authentic. I will
only transcribe two of them: 'The year after I played
Mother Cole, at Brighton, I received an invitation from
Lord Barrymore to his house, then upon the Steyne.
One night, when the champagne prevented the evening
finishing tranquilly, Lord Barrymore proposed, as there
was a guitar in the house, that I should play on it. I
was to be the musician, and he, dressed in the cook-maid's
clothes, was to sing "Ma chère amie." Accordingly,
taking me to another part of the Steyne, under
Mrs. Fitzherbert's window, (it was then three o'clock)
he sang, whilst I played the accompaniment. The next
day, he told me (quizzing, I should think,) that the
Prince said, "Barrymore, you may make yourself a fool
as much as you please; but, if I had known it was
Angelo, I would have horsewhipped him into the sea."'<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>'Lord Barrymore's fondness for eccentricities ever
engaged his mind. Whether in London, or at Wargrave,
'twas all the same, always in high spirits, thinking
of what fun he should have during the day. I shall
begin with London. Seated, after dinner, at eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
o'clock, on one of the hottest evenings in July, he
proposed that the whole party should go to Vauxhall.
The carriage being ordered, it was directly filled inside;
and the others, outside, with more wine than wit, made
no little noise through the streets. We had not been
long at Vauxhall, when Lord Barrymore called out to
a young clergyman, some little distance from us; who,
when he approached, and was asked, "Have you had
any supper?" to our surprise, he answered, "Vy, as
how, my Lord, I have not, as yet, had none." A waiter
passing by at the time, Lord Barrymore said, "You
know me; let that gentleman have whatever he calls
for:" when he told the parson to fall to, and call for as
much arrack punch as he pleased. "Thank ye, my
Lord," said he, "for I begins to be hungry, and I don't
care how soon I pecks a bit."</p>

<p>'Lord Barrymore had, that morning, unknown to us,
contrived to dress Tom Hooper, the tin man, (one of
the first pugilists at that time), as a clergyman, to be
in waiting at Vauxhall, in case we should get into any
dispute. This fistic knight now filled the place of a
lacquey, and was constantly behind the carriage, a sworn
votary of black eyes and disfigured faces. His black
clothes, formal hat, hair powdered and curled round, so
far disguised him, that he was unknown to us all, at
first, though Hooper's queer dialect must soon have discovered
him to the waiters. This was a <i lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i>
of Lord Barrymore's. About three o'clock, whilst at
supper, Lord Falkland, Henry Barry, Sir Francis
Molineux, etc., were of our party; there was, at this
time, a continual noise and rioting, and the arrack
punch was beginning to operate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>'On a sudden, all were seen running towards the
orchestra, the whole garden seemed to be in confusion,
and our party, all impatience, sallied out, those at the
farther end of the box, walking over the table, kicking
down the dishes. It seems that the effects of the punch
had not only got into Hooper's head, but had exerted
an influence over his fists, for he was for fighting with
everybody. A large ring was made; and, advancing in
a boxing attitude, he threatened to fight anyone; but
all retired before him.</p>

<p>'Felix M'Carthy, a tall, handsome Irishman, well
known by everybody at that time, soon forced his way
through the crowd, and collared him, at the same time
saying, "You rascal, you are Hooper the boxer; if you
don't leave the garden this instant, I'll kick you out."
The affrighted crowd, who, before, retreated when he
approached them, now came forward; when Hooper,
finding himself surrounded, and hearing a general cry
of "Kick him out," made his retreat as fast as possible,
thus avoiding the fury of those who would not have
spared him out of the gardens, if he had been caught.
We found him, at five in the morning, behind Lord
Barrymore's carriage, with the coachman's great coat
on, congratulating himself upon having avoided the
vengeance of those to whom, a short time previously,
he had been an object of fear.'<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Lord Barrymore met with a sad fate on March 6, 1793,
at the early age of twenty-four. He was an officer in the
2nd or Queen's Regiment, and, in pursuance of his duty,
was escorting some French prisoners to Dover. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
had kindly halted by the wayside, and treated everybody
at an inn, when, on resuming the march, being
tired, he got into his curricle, driven by his servant, he
himself smoking a pipe of tobacco. A loaded gun
which was placed between them, slipping down to the
bottom of the carriage, by some mischance went off,
and lodged its contents in his head, the charge entering
at his cheek and coming out at the upper part of his
skull. He was buried at Wargrave, and the <cite>Annual
Register</cite> says of him: 'He died in a few minutes, and
so finished a short, foolish, and dissipated life, which
had passed very discreditably to his rank as a peer, and
still more so as a member of society.'</p>

<p>He was succeeded in his title by his brother Henry
(Cripplegate), who had neither the brains nor the <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i>
of Hellgate. He is thus described by Captain
Gronow:<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>'This nobleman came of a very old family, and, when
of age, succeeded to a fine estate. He acquired no
small degree of notoriety from his love of pugilism and
cockfighting; but his <em>forte</em> lay in driving, and few
coachmen on the northern road could "tool" a four-in-hand
like him. His Lordship was one of the founders
of the "Whip Club." The first time I ever saw Lord
Barrymore was, one fine evening, while taking a stroll
in Hyde Park. The weather was charming, and a great
number of the <em>bon-ton</em> had assembled to witness the
departure of the Four-in-hand Club. Conspicuous
among all the "turn-outs" was that of his Lordship,
who drove four splendid greys, unmatched in symmetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
action and power. Lord Barrymore was, like Lord
Byron and Sir Walter Scott, club-footed. I discovered
this defect, the moment he got off his box to arrange
something wrong in the harness. If there had been a
competitive examination, the prize of which would be
given to the most proficient in slang and vulgar phraseology,
it would have been safe to back his Lordship as
the winner, against the most foul-mouthed of costermongers;
for the way he blackguarded his servants,
for the misadjustment of a strap, was horrifying. On
returning home, I dressed, and went to the Club to
dine, where I alluded to the choice morsels of English
vernacular that had fallen from the noble whip's mouth,
in addressing his servants, and was assured that such
was his usual language when out of temper.</p>

<p>'In addition to his "drag" in the Four-in-hand
Club, Lord Barrymore sported a very pretty "Stanhope,"
in which he used to drive about town, accompanied
by a little boy, whom the world denominated
his "tiger." It was reported that Lord Barrymore
had, in his younger days, been taken much notice of by
the Prince Regent; in fact, he had been the boon companion
of his Royal Highness, and had assisted at the
orgies that used to take place at Carlton House, where
he was a constant visitor. Notwithstanding this, Lord
Barrymore was considered by those intimately acquainted
with him, to be a man of literary talents. He, certainly,
was an accomplished musician, a patron of the drama,
and a great friend of Cooke, Kean and the two Kembles;
yet I have heard a host of crimes attributed to his
Lordship. This, if not a libel, showed that the connection
existing between the Prince Regent and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
nobleman could not have been productive of good
results, and tends to confirm the impression that the
profligate life led by his Royal Highness, and those
admitted to his intimacy, was such, as to make it a
matter of wonder that such scandalous scenes of debauchery
could be permitted in a country like ours.
Indeed, his acquaintance with the Prince ruined Lord
Barrymore both in mind, body and estate. While
participating in the Regent's excesses, he had bound
himself to do his bidding, however palpably iniquitous
it might be; and, when he was discarded, in accordance
with that Prince's habit of treating his favourites, he
left Carlton House ruined in health and reputation.</p>

<p>'Lord Barrymore, during his last years, was a martyr
to gout and other diseases: and, on his deathbed, he
was haunted by the recollection of what he had been,
and the thought of what he might have become: indeed,
the last scene of his profligate life, when tortured
by the inward reproaches of his accusing conscience,
was harrowing in the extreme.'</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ANOTHER of the Prince's companions,
until they quarrelled, was Charles
Howard, eleventh Duke of Norfolk, who
possessed all the habits and attributes
of a hog.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Slovenly and dirty in his
attire, he was rarely washed, but when he was drunk,
and then by his servants; and the story is told that one
day he was complaining to Dudley North that he
suffered terribly from rheumatism, for which he could
find no cure, and was answered by the question, 'Pray,
my lord, did you ever try a clean shirt?'</p>

<p>Hear what the anonymous writer of 'The Clubs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
London,' says of the old glutton, when writing of the
Beefsteak Club. Speaking of a visit to that club in
1799, he says:</p>

<p>'I do not recollect all who were present on that
day, but I particularly remarked John Kemble, Cobb of
the India House, his Royal Highness the Duke of
Clarence, Sir John Cox Hippisley, Charles Morris,
Ferguson of Aberdeen, and his Grace of Norfolk. This
nobleman took the chair when the cloth was removed.
It is a place of dignity, elevated some steps above the
table, and decorated with the various insignia of the
Society; amongst which was suspended the identical
small cocked-hat in which Garrick used to play the
part of Ranger. As soon as the clock strikes fives, a
curtain draws up, discovering the kitchen, in which the
cooks are dimly seen plying their several offices, through
a sort of grating, with this appropriate motto from
Macbeth inscribed over it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'"<span class="smcap">If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>'But the steaks themselves;&mdash;they were of the highest
order, and I can never forget the goodwill with which
they were devoured. In this respect, no one surpassed
the Duke of Norfolk. He was <i lang="la">totus in illis</i>. Eyes,
hands, mouth, were all intensely exercised; not a faculty
played the deserter. His appetite, literally, grew by
what it fed on. Two or three succeeding steaks,
fragrant from the gridiron, rapidly vanished. In my
simplicity, I thought that his labours were over. I was
deceived, for I observed him rubbing a clean plate with
a shallot, to prepare it for the reception of another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>'A pause of ten minutes ensued, and his Grace rested
upon his knife and fork; but it was only a pause, and
I found that there was a good reason for it. Like the
epic, a rump of beef has a beginning, a middle, and an
end. The palate of an experienced beef steaker can
discern all its progressive varieties, from the first cut to
the last; and he is a mere tyro in the business, who
does not know, that towards the middle, there lurks a
fifth essence, the perfect ideal of tenderness and flavour.
Epicurism itself, in its fanciful combinations of culinary
excellence, never dreamed of anything surpassing it.
For this cut, the Duke had wisely tarried, and, for this,
he re-collected his forces. At last he desisted, but
more, I thought, from fatigue than satiety: <i lang="la">lassatus
non satiatus</i>. I need not hint, that powerful irrigations
of port encouraged and relieved, at intervals, the organs
engaged in this severe duty.</p>

<p>'Nor could I help admiring that his Grace, proverbially
an idolater of the table, should have dined
with such perfect complacency upon beef steaks:&mdash;he,
whose eyes and appetite roved every day amidst the
rich variety of a ducal banquet, to which ocean, air
and earth, paid their choicest contingents. His palate,
I thought, would sigh, as in captivity, for the range in
which it was to expatiate. A member, who sat next
me, remarked that in beef steaks there was considerable
variety, and he had seen the most finished gourmands
about town quite delighted with the simple repast of
the Society. But, with regard to the Duke of Norfolk,
he hinted that it was his custom, on a beef steak day,
to eat a preliminary dish of fish in his own especial box
at the Piazza, and then adjourn time enough for the beef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
steaks. He added also, and I heartily concurred in his
remark, that a mere dish of fish could make no more
difference to the iron digestion of his Grace, than a
tenpenny nail, more or less, in that of an ostrich.</p>

<p>'After dinner, the Duke was ceremoniously ushered
to the chair, and invested with an orange coloured
ribbon, to which a silver medal, in the form of a gridiron,
was appended.... I was astonished to see how
little effect the sturdy port wine of the Society produced
on his adamantine constitution; for the same abhorrence
of a vacuum, which had disposed him to do such
ample justice to his dinner, showed itself no less in his
unflinching devotion to the bottle.'<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Sir N. Wraxall, in his 'Historical Memoirs of My
Own Time ... 1772 to 1784,' writes thus of him:
'Drunkenness was in him an hereditary vice, transmitted
down, probably, by his ancestors from the
Plantagenet times, and inherent in his formation. His
father indulged equally in it, but he did not manifest
the same capacities as his son, in resisting the effects of
wine. It is a fact that, after laying his father and all
the guests under the table at the Thatched House
Tavern in St. James's Street, he has repaired to another
festive party in the vicinity, and there recommenced
the unfinished convivial rites.'</p>

<p>The caricaturists openly made fun of his hoggish
propensities, as did the public press, <i lang="la">vide</i> these two
extracts from the <cite>Times</cite> (March 1, 1793):</p>

<p class="center">'<span class="smcap">On the late Inundation in Old Palace Yard.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'On one side, Duke Norfolk pushed forward with strife,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">For he never liked Water</span> throughout his whole life.'</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p><i>February 17, 1794.</i>&mdash;'The Duke of <span class="smcap">Norfolk</span> is
attacked by the <em>Hydrophobia</em>, he can't bear the sight
of <em>water</em>. His physicians have prescribed <span class="smcap">Wine</span>. The
Marquis of <em>Stafford</em>, Marquis of <em>Bath</em>, and Lord
<em>Thurlow</em> who were present, sanctified this prescription
with their most hearty consent.'</p>

<p>And yet it is over this wretched old sensualist that
Thackeray, in his 'Four Georges,' gets maudlinly
sentimental!</p>

<p>'And now I have one more story of the bacchanalian
sort, in which Clarence and York, and the very highest
personage of the realm, the great Prince Regent, all
play parts. The feast took place at the Pavilion at
Brighton, and was described to me by a gentleman who
was present at the scene. In Gillray's caricatures, and
amongst Fox's jolly associates, there figures a great
nobleman, the Duke of Norfolk, called Jockey of Norfolk
in his time, and celebrated for his table exploits. He
had quarrelled with the Prince, like the rest of the
Whigs; but a sort of reconciliation had taken place;
and now, being a very old man, the Prince invited
him to dine and sleep at the Pavilion, and the old
Duke drove over from his Castle of Arundel with his
famous equipage of grey horses, still remembered in
Sussex.</p>

<p>'The Prince of Wales had concocted, with his royal
brothers, a notable scheme for making the old man
drunk. Every person at table was enjoined to take
wine with the Duke&mdash;a challenge which the old toper
did not refuse. He soon began to see that there was
a conspiracy against him; he drank glass for glass; he
overthrew many of the brave. At last, the First Gentleman
of Europe proposed bumpers of brandy. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the royal brothers filled a great glass for the Duke.
He stood up and tossed off the drink. "Now," says he,
"I will have my carriage, and go home." The Prince
urged upon him his previous promise to sleep under the
roof where he had been so generously entertained. "No,"
he said, he had had enough of such hospitality. A trap
had been set for him; he would leave the place at once,
and never enter its doors more.</p>

<p>'The carriage was called, and came; but, in the half
hour's interval, the liquor had proved too potent for
the old man: his host's generous purpose was answered,
and the old man's grey head lay stupefied on the table.
Nevertheless, when his post chaise was announced, he
staggered to it as well as he could, and stumbling in,
bade the postilions drive to Arundel. They drove him
for half an hour round and round the Pavilion lawn;
the poor old man fancied he was going home. When
he awoke that morning he was in bed at the Prince's
hideous house at Brighton. You may see the place now
for sixpence: they have fiddlers there every day; and,
sometimes, buffoons and mountebanks hire the Riding
House, and do their tricks and tumbling there. The
trees are still there, and the gravel walks round which
the poor old sinner was trotted. I can fancy the flushed
faces of the royal princes as they support themselves at
the portico pillars, and look on at old Norfolk's disgrace;
but I can't fancy how the man who perpetrated it continued
to be called a gentleman.'</p>

<p>Another of the Prince's intimates and visitor to the
Pavilion was that disreputable old roué William Douglas,
third Earl of March and fourth Duke of Queensberry,
commonly called 'Old Q,' well known on the turf as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
racehorse-owner and betting man, a thorough gambler
and finished debauchee.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'And there, insatiate yet with folly's sport,</div>
<div class="verse">That polished, sin-worn fragment of the Court,</div>
<div class="verse">The shade of Queensb'ry should with Clermont meet,</div>
<div class="verse">Ogling and hobbling down St. James's Street.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nearly forty years older than the Prince, he was his
Mentor in every kind of vice, and rooked him of thousands
of pounds at play and in betting.</p>

<p>Thackeray, in 'The Virginians,' portrays him under
no pseudonym. He is called simply by his title of Lord
March. In Chapter XXVI. Mr. Warrington is at the
White Horse Tavern, where are Lords Chesterfield and
March:</p>

<p>'"My Lord Chesterfield's deuce is deuce ace," says
my Lord March. "His Lordship can't keep away from
the cards, or dice."</p>

<p>'"My Lord March has not one, but several devils.
He loves gambling, he loves horse-racing, he loves
betting, he loves drinking, he loves eating, he loves
money, he loves women, and you have fallen into bad
company, Mr. Warrington, when you lighted upon his
Lordship. He will play you for every acre you have in
Virginia."</p>

<p>'"With the greatest pleasure in life, Mr. Warrington!"
interposes my Lord.</p>

<p>'"And for all your tobacco, and for all your spices,
and for all your slaves, and for all your oxen and asses."</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'"Unfortunately, my Lord, the tobacco, and the
slaves, and the asses, and the oxen, are not mine, as yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
I am just of age, and my mother&mdash;scarce twenty years
older&mdash;has quite as good chance of long life as I have."</p>

<p>'"I will bet that you survive her. I will pay you a
sum now, against four times the sum to be paid at her
death. I will set a fair sum over this table against the
reversion of your estate in Virginia at the old lady's
departure."'</p>

<p>Certainly, it is pleasant to turn from such companions
of Florizel's to another, whose only fault was his conviviality.
I mean Captain Charles Morris, punch-maker
and bard to the Beefsteak Society, where he met with
the Prince, at his admission into the society, in 1785;
and the author of the 'Clubs of London' thus describes
him:</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="CAPTAIN_MORRIS"></a>
<img src="images/i_157fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">CAPTAIN MORRIS.</div>
</div>

<p>'But Charles Morris&mdash;can anyone think of the Beefsteaks
without including thy revered image in the
picture? The faculties of man are not equal to an
abstraction so metaphysical. For many, many years,
during which several of man's autumnal generations
have fallen, he has been faithful to his post. He is
the bard of the Society, who, in the person of this, her
favourite disciple, may still boast <i lang="la">non caret vate sacro</i>,
fortune has not yet struck this old deer of the forest.
You should have seen him, as was his wont at the
period I am speaking of, making the Society's punch,
his ancient and rightful office. It was pleasing to see
him at his laboratory at the side board, stocked with
the varied products that enter into the composition of
that nectareous mixture; then, smacking an elementary
glass, or two, and giving a significant nod, the fiat of
its excellence; and what could exceed the extasy with
which he filled the glasses that thronged round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
bowl; joying over its mantling beauties with an artist's
pride, and distributing the fascinating draught</p>

<p>
'"That flames and dances in its crystal bound."'<br />
</p>

<p>Morris's songs, which after his death were published
in two volumes, under the title of 'Lyra Urbanica,'
rendered him a welcome guest at Carlton House and the
Pavilion; and, strange to say, he enjoyed the favour
and countenance of Florizel, both as Prince and King,
until the death of his royal patron.</p>

<p>We have a very good portrait of Captain Morris,
dated July 1, 1789, with the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'When the fancy stirring Bowl</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Wakes its World of pleasure,</div>
<div class="verse">Glowing Visions gild my Soul,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And Life's an endless treasure.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These were some of the more notorious of the Prince's
intimates at that time; some of the minor ones may be
mentioned later on.</p>

<p>We hear very little of the Prince at Brighton in
1791. He went there, for the season, on June 13, and
he soon had his old set round him. I can only find one
record of their doings, and that is in the <cite>Sussex Weekly
Advertiser</cite> of September 26: 'Between six and seven
o'clock, on Monday morning last, the Prince, accompanied
by Sir John Lade, in his curricle, drove through
this town, on a shooting excursion, to Haremere, an
estate belonging to Sir John; but no day ever proved
more unfavourable to the sport, for the gamekeeper
who attended on the occasion, with all his diligence,
was unable to spring more than one solitary bird.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
About seven in the evening his Royal Highness returned
here, and, after taking fresh horses, which were in
readiness at the White Hart, proceeded on to Brighton.</p>

<p>'Lady Lade and the Barrys had the honour to be of
the party. Her Ladyship, in rallying the Prince and
Sir John, on their bad success, observed she thought
even an object as large as a goose, might, with great
safety, come in their way; but was, soon after, convinced
of her error, by being presented with a goose,
which the Prince and Sir John had shot in a neighbouring
pond. The joke was accompanied with great
pleasantry; and the farmer, who owned the goose, had
the benefit of it, by receiving a handsome present from
the Royal purse.'</p>

<p>In 1792 the Prince went down to Brighton earlier
than usual&mdash;in April&mdash;and his regiment was quartered
there for the defence of the coast; things on the
Continent were very disturbed, and war with France
broke out the next year. We read in the <cite>Sussex
Weekly Advertiser</cite> of May 21: 'On Friday the
10th Regiment of Light Dragoons had a grand field
day, in honour of the Prince; after which, his Royal
Highness honoured the officers with his company to
dinner, at the Old Ship tavern; and, the next morning,
set out for town. The Prince is expected at
Brighton this day, previous to the grand review of his
regiment to-morrow, by Gen. Lascelles, on the Downs,
near that place. On Friday next, the above regiment
is to have another field day, in review order, at which
the Duke and Duchess of York are expected to be
present.'</p>

<p>The French Revolution was seething, and prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
people were leaving France. We read in the same
newspaper: 'There has been, lately, a great importation
of <em>French Emigrants</em> to Brighthelmstone. Last
Wednesday, twelve of them, seemingly persons of distinction,
passed through this town, in four post chaises,
on their route to Dover, in order to embark there for
Brussels. Another cargo of the same quality, has also
been smuggled in an open boat to Bulverhithe,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> on our
coast, likewise on their way to the ex-Princes.'</p>

<p><i lang="fr">En passant</i>, let me just give one anecdote of the
manners and customs of Brighton at this time <em>re</em>
smuggling (<cite>Sussex Weekly Advertiser</cite>, August 27, 1792):
'On Wednesday last, a smuggling cutter, having been
closely chased at sea, in order to lighten her lading,
threw 300 tubs of spirits overboard, and, by means
thereof, escaped her pursuers. The Brighton fishermen
seeing many of the tubs float on a very rough sea
before that town, swam out at the hazard of their lives
and saved some of them. Two Revenue officers, who
looked on while these hardy sons of Neptune buffeted
the angry waves for the sake of their favourite grog,
endeavoured to seize the fruits of their labour. But,
one of them, in pursuing a woman, who had received a
tub from her husband, or brother, fell down the bank
and broke one of his legs, in a manner that the bone
appeared through his stocking. The other, having
gone down on the beach, in order more effectually to
intercept his prey, was hustled by the crowd off one of
the groins, and broke three of his ribs in the fall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Honest Jack, seeing his foes thus disabled, secured every
tub that fell in his way, and in his dripping jacket,
drank confusion to Excise.'</p>

<p>On August 27 Florizel gave a fête to celebrate his
birthday, and this is a contemporary account of it
(<cite>Sussex Weekly Advertiser</cite>, September 3): 'At the
Prince's fête on Brighton Level, last Monday, no fewer
than four thousand persons were supposed to have
attended; the majority to feast their eyes, while the
others feasted more substantially on a fine ox, with a
proportionate quantity of bread and strong beer prepared
for the occasion. The ox was taken from the
fire about 3 o'clock, and very skilfully dissected by
Mr. Russel, at the bottom of a large pit, while the
spectators and expectants stood, in theatric gradation,
on its sloping sides. The day proved very favourable
to this rustic festivity. His Royal Highness's guests
were very accommodating and good humoured to each
other, until the strong beer began to operate. The
Prince and Mrs. Fitzherbert looked on for a considerable
time with great good humour, and had the satisfaction
of hearing that no accident nor injury occurred
in so large a concourse, except a few blackeyes and
bloody noses, at the close of the evening.'</p>

<p>The French Revolution grew apace. On August 10
the Royal Swiss Guards were cut to pieces and 5,000
persons massacred. On August 26 there was a decree
of the National Assembly against the priests, and 40,000
of them were exiled. From September 2 to 5 there was
a fearful massacre in Paris; the prisons were broken
open, and 1,200 persons, including 100 priests, were
slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these priests Charlotte Smith speaks in her poem
called 'The Emigrants':</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ABOUT this time the <i lang="fr">émigrés</i> poured into
Brighton, and happy were those who
could thus save their lives. Here is a contemporary
account, given in the <cite>Sussex
Weekly Advertiser</cite>, September 3, 1792:</p>

<p>'Brighton once favoured the escape of a sovereign
from his enraged subjects. The former town is now
become the refuge of the persecuted <i lang="fr">noblesse</i> of a neighbouring
state. The former returned to his country
and kingdom, untaught by affliction, and ungrateful to
loyalty that had bled in his service. And it is to be
feared, that if the bayonets of combined despotism
restore the latter to their late rank and power, petty
tyranny will revive, and human nature, exhausted in
the unequal struggle for freedom, again lick the feet of
her oppressors, in debility and despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>'On Wednesday last (<em>Aug. 29</em>) Madame (<i lang="fr">Duchesse de</i>)
Noailles arrived at Brighton from France, and was
received with the most polite and cordial hospitality,
by his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and Mrs.
Fitzherbert. Her husband being a counter revolutionist,
she found it very unsafe to remain any longer in Paris,
or any other part of France, and sent her child and
nurse before her, who took their passages from Dieppe
to Brighton, where they arrived about a week ago. The
lady, herself, had more difficulty in leaving her native
land; but we are far from vouching for the reality of
all the sufferings which are said to have attended her
emigration. Travelling in breeches<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> was no very great
distress; but the coil of cable which is said to have
enclosed her for <em>fourteen hours</em>, smells not less of the
<em>marvellous</em>, than the <em>tar</em>. This, in the hands of a
novelist, might be spun out to something <em>monstrous
pathetic</em>.</p>

<p>'It is also said that the Marchioness de Bouillé
(? Beaulé), whose safety in France might have been no
less precarious than that of the other fair fugitive, hired
an open boat at Dieppe, in which she committed herself
to the mercy of the winds and waves; and, after a very
tempestuous passage, arrived safe, on Wednesday last,
at Brighton.</p>

<p>'Some Frenchmen, seemingly of distinction, landed
last Wednesday morning, after a very rough passage,
in an open boat, at Newhaven; and, on Friday, went
post from this town for the Capital.'</p>

<p><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;'On Wednesday and Thursday last,
no less than <em>one hundred and seventy</em> French emigrants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
mostly priests, were landed from the packets, and an
open boat at Brighton. More are daily arriving; and,
many of them being observed to labour under very
distressed circumstances, we hear a subscription has
been opened for their relief, at Mr. Crawford's library.</p>

<p>'On Friday and Saturday last, near three hundred
unfortunate Frenchmen of the above description were
put on shore at Eastbourne, many of whom were
hospitably received by Lord George Cavendish, Lord
Bayham, A. Piggott, Esq<sup>re</sup>, and many other of the
Nobility and Gentry of that place. They, afterwards,
took different routes for the Metropolis. Many, from
the above place and Brighton, came to this town, and
such as could not get places on the stage coach, hired
carts for their conveyance. Five of them, seemingly of
a superior order, who brought a letter of recommendation
to a gentleman of this town, have fixed their abode
there.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'Mrs. Fitzherbert, the Duchess de Noailles, and many
other ladies of distinction, were present at the Cricket
match, and dined in a marquee pitched on the ground,
for that purpose. The Prince's band of music attended,
and played during the whole time the ladies were at
dinner. In the evening, Mrs. Fitzherbert, the Duchess,
Lady Clermont, and Miss Piggott, walked round the
ground, seemingly the better to gratify the spectators
with a sight of the French lady.</p>

<p>'The Duchess de Noailles appears to be 21, or 22
years of age, is very handsome, and her figure and
deportment are remarkably interesting.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p><i>September 17, 1792.</i>&mdash;'Upwards of five hundred unfortunate
emigrants were, last week, landed on our
coast, who have had the fury of the elements to contend
with, after escaping that of their barbarous countrymen.
The Brighton packets, heavily laden with them,
were driven by the winds far eastward of their usual
track; and, with difficulty, made Hastings, Pevensey,
and Eastbourne. At the former place, on Wednesday
morning, <em>seventy six</em>, all ecclesiastics, came on shore;
among whom were the <em>Bishop of Avranches</em>, the <em>Dean
of Rouen</em>, and several other dignitaries. The Bishop,
with great difficulty, escaped from <em>Avranches</em> with the
assistance of one of his Grand Vicars, who, with one of
his domestics, accompanied him to <em>Rouen</em>, where they
were, for some days, concealed. The populace, however,
having discovered them, they were, again, obliged
to fly. They travelled thence, on foot, in disguise, to
<em>Dieppe</em>, at which place they arrived in the night, and
took refuge, for a few hours, at a hotel. Thence, at
the time appointed for the departure of the packet, they
ran to the sea side, and, as it was, providentially for
them, high water, they were enabled to put off, and
instantly get out of the reach of the rabble, who, in
less than one minute afterwards, pursued them to the
shore, and, with savage fury, declared that it was their
intention to have murdered them on the spot.</p>

<p>'The Bishop and his Grand Vicar were hospitably received
at Hastings by the Rev. Mr. Whitear, who entertained
them till Saturday, when they left that place for
London. It is the duty of every Magistrate and
Gentleman to prevent the lower classes in this country
from imposing upon these poor fugitives. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
sorry to learn that, at Hastings, the <em>exactions</em> of the
boatmen, on Wednesday last, were shameful in the
extreme. They refused to bring any of the Frenchmen
on shore for less than four <em>shillings</em> a man; and some
even raised their fare to <em>five shillings</em>.&mdash;Among <em>English</em>
mariners, we thought that such <em>unjust</em> and <em>unfeeling</em>
wretches were not to be found.'</p>

<p>A notice of the nuns who took refuge here must
close this episode:</p>

<p><i>October 29, 1792.</i>&mdash;'The Nuns, whose arrival at
Brighthelmstone was mentioned in our last paper, were
driven from a convent at <em>Lisle</em>. At the time of their
debarkation they had only about thirty pounds in
specie remaining, all the valuables of their convent
having been seized on by the <em>regenerate</em> French. The
Prince and Mrs. Fitzherbert paid them a very long visit
at the New Ship Inn; after which, his Royal Highness
set on foot a subscription for their relief, which, in a
short time, amounted to upwards of one hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>'The above ladies, on the evening of their arrival,
celebrated High Mass, with great solemnity, in an
apartment at their inn.</p>

<p>''Twas remarkable that no two of the above nuns
could be prevailed on to sleep in one bed.'</p>

<p><i>October 1, 1792.</i>&mdash;'The Prince, we hear, has it in
contemplation, to take down, and entirely rebuild, on a
much larger scale, his Marine Pavilion at Brighthelmstone;'
but he did not do it just then, as he was
woefully hard up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="A_VOLUPTUARY"></a>
<img src="images/i_167fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">A VOLUPTUARY UNDER THE HORRORS OF DIGESTION.</div>
</div>

<p>Of course, during the year the Prince did not escape
the pencil of the satirist, and there was a print published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
on May 23, to understand which it must be premised
that formerly, at the opening of Courts of Assize and
Quarter Sessions in England, a proclamation against
vice and immorality was always read. This print is
called '<span class="smcap">Vices overlooked in the New Proclamation</span>,'
in which are depicted the King and Queen as <span class="smcap">Avarice</span>,
the Prince as <span class="smcap">Drunkenness</span>, the Duke of York as
<span class="smcap">Gambling</span>, and the Duke of Clarence and Mrs. Jordan
as <span class="smcap">Debauchery</span>.</p>

<p>Another, published July 2, is 'A Voluptuary under
the Horrors of Digestion.'</p>

<p>This is an excellent likeness of the Prince, who, with
unbuttoned waistcoat, lolls in an armchair, picking his
teeth with a fork. On the ground are dice, a Newmarket
List, Debts of Honour unpaid, and Faro partnership
Account, Self, Archer,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Hobart and Co.</p>

<p>In February, 1793, war was declared between France
and England, and volunteers were enrolled for the
defence of their country. Camps were formed at
different parts of the coast, and there was one at
Brighton in August of that year. Needless to say that
the Prince's regiment was quartered there, and he himself
showed in great force. A contemporary<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> gives us
an account of this camp, written by a volunteer:</p>

<p>'<i>Brighton Camp, August 22.</i>&mdash;On the Monday,
whatever mistakes (if commanders can make any) had
prolonged the order of march from Waterdown, they
were removed, and the line reached Chailey in good
time. With equal glee and regularity, they set off, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
next morning, for Brighton: about four miles before
they arrived on their ground, their regiments were
formed in battalions, in which order they moved, keeping
good wheeling distance. The irregularity of the
Downs frequently gave an opportunity of seeing every
regiment with a <i lang="fr">coup d'œil</i>. Numbers of people came
out to meet us. The town, with the sea and the music,
and the universal animation around, somewhat dissipated
the fatigue of a long march. Conspicuous
among the spectators, was the Prince of Wales, in the
honourable garb of his regiment, looking both the
Soldier and the Prince. We marched by his Royal
Highness by divisions, officers saluting, and then
wheeled round the town to our new ground, which
appeared a little Paradise, in comparison.</p>

<p>'The water at our former stations had too much
chalybeate in it to be pleasant. On Chailey common it
was good; and, on our arrival here, we had the luxury
of finding it could not be better. This necessary part
of the comforts of life, with the delightful ground we
are encamped upon, a full advantage of the sea breeze,
and the lively scene continually passing and repassing
in our front, make us hope we shall have more opportunities
of frequenting the Steine Parade than we had
of visiting Tunbridge Wells. Besides, the Commander
in Chief wonderfully gave us an overslaugh from Wednesday
until Monday; on which day we were out six
hours and a half; five of the hours dragged on with the
usual having nothing to do. We then began to form
columns and lines. This intention was by way of drilling
in the new system. General Dundas, the modeller of it,
gave his personal assistance; and I could not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
remarking how gracefully and expeditiously he moved
his sun burnt hand, explanatory of his formation of the
divisions into battalion. I dare say, when we have
brought his theory to practical perfection, we shall
never be a hair's breadth out. Old officers, who have
been accustomed to fight after the old school, find great
fault with many parts of this celebrated system.'</p>

<p>This camp consisted of about 10,000 men, regulars,
militia, and volunteers, and was situated at Hove, where
it continued till October 28. Two new batteries were
built, one on the west cliff, which mounted eight
twenty-four pounders, and the other on the east cliff,
where were four guns of the same weight.</p>

<p>The <cite>Annual Register</cite>, August 21, gives the following:
'Last Sunday, the Rev. Dr. Knox (a gentleman well
known in the literary world as the author of several
essays) preached at Brighton church. He took his
text from St. Luke; "Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace and good will towards men!" In
enlarging on this subject, he spoke in very strong terms
of the calamities of war, and said that the tinsel of
military parade was but a poor compensation for the
innumerable miseries that were the too sure attendants
upon a state of warfare; that the voice of religion was
but little heard amidst the roar of cannon, the shouts
of conquerors, and the splendour of victory. In another
part of his discourse, he said that religion and philosophy
seemed to have but little weight in the councils of the
rulers of the world.</p>

<p>'Several military officers in the church, officiously
took upon themselves to think that the sermon was an
attack upon the constitution of the country, and that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
contained improper reflections upon the profession to
which they belonged.</p>

<p>'Last night, Dr. Knox and his family being in one
of the boxes at the theatre, there were, also, several
officers in the house. At the end of the play, a note
was handed by the boxkeeper, to Dr. Knox, stating
that it was the desire of several gentlemen then present,
that he should withdraw. The note being without a
signature, Dr. Knox took no notice of it. Several
officers then stood up, and insisted on his leaving the
house immediately.</p>

<p>'A scene of much confusion, nearly bordering on
personal violence, ensued. Dr. Knox attempted to
speak, but was, absolutely, forcibly hindered from proceeding;
and himself, Mrs. Knox, and two or three of
their little children, were compelled to leave the house,
to avoid <em>military</em> coercion.'</p>

<p>Florizel, commanding his regiment, and playing at
soldiers, was in his element, as the following extracts
from the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite> show:</p>

<p><i>August 13-15.</i>&mdash;'Monday, being the anniversary of
the Prince of Wales' birth, the same was celebrated at
Brighton; the morning was ushered in by the ringing
of bells; and, at one o'clock, the guns of the salute
battery were fired. Several of the nobility, who went
down to pay their compliments to the Prince, visited
his Royal Highness in the Pavilion, who gave a very
superb entertainment to the officers of his regiment, etc.,
in his Marquee. In the evening there was a grand ball
in the Castle, which was numerously attended.'</p>

<p><i>September 5-7.</i>&mdash;'In the high winds of Wednesday
night, the Prince of Wales's Marquee, in the Camp at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Brighton, was blown down; his Royal Highness, however,
suffered nothing; for, except on the nights when
he is Colonel of the Camp, his residence is in the
Pavilion. Many of the officers and men had their tents
blown down on the same night.'</p>

<p>This marquee was a very splendid and spacious affair,
with a kitchen and all sorts of conveniences attached.
Indeed, Florizel was ever attentive to his own comfort,
<i lang="la">vide</i> the following account of his new travelling-carriage:</p>

<p><i>August 22-24.</i>&mdash;'The Prince of Wales has just built
a long carriage for travelling&mdash;it is so constructed, that,
in a few moments, it forms a neat chamber, with a
handsome bed, and every other convenience for passing
the night in it, on the road, or in a camp.'</p>

<p>It is all very nice to have travelling-carriages and
marquees, and whatever one's soul desires, but if the
income is a fixed one, albeit over £70,000 a year, there
must be a limit to expenditure. Poor Florizel was
deeply in debt, and one of his best friends, the Earl of
Malmesbury, tells us about it:<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>'Landed at Dover on Saturday, June 2nd, 1792....
Saw Prince of Wales early the 4th&mdash;he was very well
pleased with what I had done at Berlin, thanked me
for it, etc.&mdash;Stated his affairs to me as more distressed
than ever&mdash;Several executions had been in his house&mdash;Lord
Rawdon had saved him from one&mdash;that his debts
amounted to £370,000. He said he was trying,
through the Chancellor, to prevail on the King to
apply to Parliament to increase his income.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>'On the Wednesday following, I was with him by
appointment. He repeated the same again; said that
if the King would raise his revenue to £100,000 a year,
he would appropriate £35,000 of it to pay the interest
of his debts, and establish a Sinking fund. That, if
this could not be done, he must break up his establishment,
reduce his income to £10,000 a year, and <em>go
abroad</em>. He <em>made a merit</em> of having given up the turf,
and blamed the Duke of York for remaining on it.
He said (which I well knew before), that his racing
stable cost him upwards of £30,000 yearly. He was
very anxious, and, as is usual on these occasions, nervous
and agitated. He said (on my asking him the question),
that he did not stand so well with the King, as
he did some months ago, but that he was better than
ever with the Queen&mdash;that <em>she</em> had advised him to
press the King, through the Chancellor, to propose to
Mr. Pitt to bring an increase of the Prince's income
before Parliament, and that, if this was done, she would
use her influence to promote it.</p>

<p>'I strongly recommended his pressing the Queen.
He suggested the idea of going to Mr. Pitt <em>directly</em>
through the Chancellor, etc. I doubted both the
consent of the Chancellor to such a step, at the
moment he was going out, and his influence and
weight if he did consent to it. I took the liberty
of disapproving his going abroad, on any terms, and,
particularly, under the circumstances he mentioned;
said, that if he should, unfortunately, be reduced to the
necessity of lowering his income to the degree he had
mentioned, it would be much better to live in England,
than <em>out</em> of it. That the showing, in England, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<em>could</em> reduce his expences, and live economically, would
do him credit, prove him in earnest, and if he kept up
to such a plan, would, in the event, be much more
likely to induce the public to take his situation into
consideration, than any attempts through Ministry,
Opposition, or even the Queen herself.</p>

<p>'I saw the Prince again on the 7th June, at Carlton
House, as before. He repeated the same things, and
added, that, if he could not obtain some assurance from
the King that he would apply to Parliament in the
next Session of Parliament, before this ended, that he
should be ruined, and <em>must go abroad</em>&mdash;I, again, combated
this idea; but he appeared to have a wish and
some whim about going abroad, I could not discover.&mdash;He
talked coldly and unaffectionately about the Duke
and Duchess of York, and very slightingly of the Duke
of Clarence.</p>

<p>'Colonel St. Leger called on me on the 8th June.
He said the Prince was more attached to Mrs. Fitzherbert
than ever; that he had been living with Mrs.
Crouch<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; that she (Mrs. Fitzherbert) piqued him by
treating this with ridicule, and coquetted on her side.
This hurt his vanity, and brought him back; and he is,
now, more under her influence than ever.'</p>

<p>And yet he could sacrifice her, in order to get his
debts paid, and himself have a larger income to
squander. There was but one way out of his mess:
that he must commit bigamy, and deliberately repudiate
his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>On August 24, 1794, the King wrote thus to Pitt
from Weymouth:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Agreeable to what I mentioned to Mr. Pitt before
I came here, I have this morning seen the Prince of
Wales, who has acquainted me with his having broken
off all connection with Mrs. Fitzherbert, and his desire
of entering into a more creditable line of life, by marrying;
expressing, at the same time, that his wish is that
my niece, the Princess of Brunswick, may be the person.
Undoubtedly she is the person who, naturally, must be
most agreeable to me. I expressed my approbation of
the idea, provided his plan was to lead a life that would
make him appear respectable, and, consequently, render
the Princess happy. He assured me that he perfectly
coincided with me in opinion. I then said that till
Parliament assembled, no arrangement could be taken,
except my sounding my sister, that no idea of any other
marriage may be encouraged.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>At this time Lady Jersey, a lady of mature age, had
great influence over the Prince, and this probably
made his rupture with Mrs. Fitzherbert the easier.
The caricaturist (this time J. Cruikshank), who always
seems to have been as well posted up in any Court
scandal as one of our Society papers, has a picture,
August 26, 1794, '<span class="smcap">My Grandmother</span>, alias the <span class="smcap">Jersey
Jig</span>, alias the <span class="smcap">Rival Widows</span>.' Old Lady Jersey, who
is taking snuff, sits on the knee of the Prince, who says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'I've kissed &amp; I've prattled with fifty Grand Dames,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And changed them as oft, do you see;</div>
<div class="verse">But of all the Grand Mammys that dance on the Steine,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The Widow of Jersey give me.'</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Fitzherbert, one hand clasping her forehead, and
in the other holding a bond for £6,000 per annum,
cries distractedly: 'Was it for this Paltry Consideration
I sacrificed my&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;? for this only I submitted
to&mdash;to&mdash;? Oh! shame for ever on my ruin'd
Greatness!!!'</p>

<p>It came very suddenly. Both Mrs. Fitzherbert and
the Prince were to dine with the Duke of Clarence;
the lady was there, but Florizel was not; instead, a
letter from him was handed to his wife repudiating her.
Lord Stourton had the story from her own lips. Let
him tell it:</p>

<p>'Her first separation from the Prince was preceded
by no quarrel, or even coolness, and came upon her
quite unexpectedly. She received, when sitting down
to dinner at the table of William the Fourth, then
Duke of Clarence, the first intimation of the loss of her
ascendancy over the affections of the Prince; having,
only the preceding day, received a note from his Royal
Highness, written in his usual strain of friendship, and
speaking of their appointed engagement to dine at the
house of the Duke of Clarence. The Prince's letter
was written from Brighton, where he had met Lady
Jersey. From that time she never saw the Prince, and
this interruption of their intimacy was followed by
his marriage with Queen Caroline; brought about, as
Mrs. Fitzherbert conceived, under the twofold influence
of the pressure of his debts on the mind of the Prince,
and a wish on the part of Lady Jersey to enlarge the
Royal Establishment, in which she was to have an
important situation.</p>

<p>'Upon her speaking to me of this union (confiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in her own desire that I should disguise from her
nothing that I might conceive to be of doubtful
character as affecting her conduct to the Prince), I
told her I had been informed that some proposals had
been made to her immediately preceding the marriage
of the Prince, of which her uncle, Mr. Errington, had
been the channel, offering some terms upon which his
Royal Highness was disposed to give up the match.
She told me there was no truth whatever in the report;
that a day or two preceding the marriage, he had been
seen passing rapidly on horseback before her house at
Marble Hill, but that his motive for doing so, was
unknown to her; and that, afterwards, when they were
reconciled, she cautiously abstained from alluding to
such topics; as the greatest interruptions to their
happiness, at that period, were his bitter and passionate
regrets and self accusations for his conduct,
which she always met by saying&mdash;"We must look to
the present and the future, and not think of the past."</p>

<p>'I ventured, also, to mention another report, that
George the Third, the day before the marriage, had
offered to take upon himself the responsibility of
breaking off the match with the Princess of Brunswick,
should the Prince desire it. Of this, too, she told me,
she knew nothing; but added, that it was not improbable,
for the King was a good and religious man. She
owned, that she was deeply distressed and depressed in
spirits at this formal abandonment, with all its consequences,
as it affected her reputation in the eyes of the
world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="THE_RAGE"></a>
<img src="images/i_177fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE RAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>'One of her great friends and advisers, Lady Claremont,
supported her on this trying occasion, and coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>selled
her to rise above her own feelings, and to open
her house to the town of London. She adopted the
advice, much as it cost her to do so; and all the
fashionable world, including all the Royal Dukes,
attended her parties. Upon this, as upon all other
occasions, she was principally supported by the Duke
of York, with whom, through life, she was always
united in the most friendly and confidential relations.
Indeed, she frequently assured me, that there was not
one of the Royal family who had not acted with kindness
to her. She particularly instanced the Queen;
and, as for George the Third, from the time she set
foot in England, till he ceased to reign, had he been
her own father, he could not have acted towards her
with greater tenderness and affection. She had made
it her constant rule to have no secrets of which the
Royal Family were not informed by frequent messages,
of which, the Duke of York was, generally, the organ
of communication, and, to that rule, she attributed, at
all periods, much of her own contentment and ease in
extricating herself from embarrassments which would,
otherwise, have been insurmountable.'</p>

<p>Compare this paragraph with the ideas of the pictorial
satirist on her abandonment. Take, for instance,
'The Rage,' published November 21, 1794. Here we
see Mrs. Fitzherbert, having thrown off her Princess of
Wales's coronet, with clenched fists and dishevelled hair,
sparring at the new Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>Another, which is of the same date, and is called
'Penance for past Folly,' shows Mrs. Fitzherbert weeping,
and on her knees, before a Roman Catholic priest,
who holds a birch rod in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The newspapers had an early inkling of the state of
affairs between Mrs. Fitzherbert and the Prince, and
the following cuttings from the <cite>Times</cite> of 1794 do not
redound much to the paper's credit, or knowledge:</p>

<p><i>July 21.</i>&mdash;'A <span class="smcap">certain lady</span> has not been so improvident
as the beauteous harlot in the days of
<span class="smcap">Edward</span>. She has, wisely, laid up ample provision for a
rainy day; and, therefore, her approach, unlike to that
of <span class="smcap">Shore</span>, is still as likely as ever to make "a little
holiday!"'</p>

<p><i>July 23.</i>&mdash;'We have, hitherto, forborne to mention
the report in circulation for many days past, of the
<span class="smcap">final separation</span> between a <span class="smcap">Gentleman</span> of the most
<span class="smcap">distinguished rank</span>, and a <span class="smcap">Lady</span> who resides in <em>Pall
Mall</em>, until we had an opportunity to ascertain the <span class="smcap">fact</span>
beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>'We are now enabled to state from the most undoubted
authority, that a final separation between the
parties in question has <span class="smcap">actually taken place</span>; that the
agreements formerly entered into, have been given up
by mutual consent; that a new contract has been
signed, by which the lady is <em>secured</em> in the possession of
£4,000 per annum, for her life, besides retaining her
house in Pall Mall, plate, jewels, etc.</p>

<p>'Mrs. <span class="smcap">Fitzherbert</span> has no intention of retiring into
Switzerland, as has been reported. She is looking out
for a house at, or near, Margate, where she means to
reside for six months, in the society of the Duchess of
<span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">E. Luttrell</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Concannon</span>,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and
others of her old acquaintance.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 5.</i>&mdash;'Mrs. <span class="smcap">Fitzherbert</span>, we learn, wished to
have a title and £4,000 annuity settled on her, but this
was peremptorily refused.'</p>

<p><i>August 7.</i>&mdash;'Much has been said respecting the
jointure settled on Mrs. <span class="smcap">Fitzherbert</span>, in consequence of
a late separation; but the precise fact has never been
hitherto stated.&mdash;The truth is this:&mdash;When the incumbrances
of a certain <span class="smcap">great personage</span> were put in a
state of settlement, two, or three years since, £3,000 a
year was allotted out of his revenues, for Mrs. <span class="smcap">Fitzherbert</span>,
which has been punctually paid by Mr. <span class="smcap">Coutts</span>,
the banker. This sum has been lately settled on
the lady for life; which, with her own private fortune
of £1,800 annually, will make her present income
£4,800 a year. Unincumbered as she now is, the lady
will, probably, be a happier woman than she has ever
been.'</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/e.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">EARLY in the summer of 1794 another
encampment took place at Brighton,
about a mile and a half to the west of
the town, as it then was. It consisted
of about 7,000 men, and did not break
up until the second week in November. The Prince
was at the Pavilion in May, but not much afterwards.
Mrs. Fitzherbert did not go there this year.</p>

<p>The King, in his speech in opening the session of
Parliament, on December 30, 1794, said: 'I have the
greatest satisfaction in announcing to you the happy
event of the conclusion of a treaty for the marriage
of my son, the Prince of Wales, with the Princess
Caroline, daughter of the Duke of Brunswick; the
constant proofs of your affection for my person and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
family persuade me that you will participate in the
sentiments I feel on an occasion so interesting to my
domestic happiness, and that you will enable me to make
provision for such an establishment, as you may think
suitable to the rank and dignity of the Heir apparent to
the crown of these kingdoms.'</p>

<p>As soon as possible afterwards the pictorial satirist
has (January 24, 1795) <span class="smcap">The Lover's Dream</span>.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The Prince is represented as asleep in bed, and
dreaming of his coming bride, who is descending from
heaven, accompanied by Cupids, and driving away
Bacchus, Fox, the Jews, Mrs. Fitzherbert and fiends,
racehorses, etc.; and by the bedside are the King and
Queen, the former holding a bag labelled £15,000 per
annum.</p>

<p>Much Florizel cared for reforming his character; he
only wanted to get clear of debts, and have an increased
income; and, not caring how he obtained this relief, he
committed bigamy on April 8, 1795, in order to obtain
the longed-for relief. His debts were, according to a
schedule presented to Parliament, up to April 5, as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>On April 27 the King sent a message to his faithful
Commons respecting an establishment for the Prince
and Princess of Wales, and in the last paragraph he
says: 'Anxious as his Majesty must necessarily be,
particularly under the present circumstances, to relieve
the Prince of Wales from these difficulties, his Majesty
entertains no idea of proposing to his Parliament to
make any provision for this object, otherwise than by
the application of a part of the income which may be
settled on the Prince; but he earnestly recommends it
to the House, to consider of the propriety of thus
providing for the gradual discharge of these incumbrances,
by appropriating and securing, for a given
term, the revenues arising from the Duchy of Cornwall,
together with a proportion of the Prince's other annual
income; and his Majesty will be ready and desirous to
concur in any provisions which the wisdom of Parliament
may suggest for the purpose of establishing a
regular and punctual order of payment in the Prince's
future expenditure, and of guarding against the possibility
of the Prince being again involved in so painful
and embarrassing a situation.'</p>

<p>On May 14 the House went into Committee on the
subject. Pitt pointed out that fifty years previously
the Prince's grandfather, as Prince of Wales, had an
annual income of £100,000. 'He, therefore, now proposed,
that the income of his Royal Highness should be
£125,000, exclusive of the Duchy of Cornwall, which
was only £25,000 a year more than was enjoyed 50
years ago. This being the only vote he had to propose,
he should merely state, in the nature of a notice,
those regulations which were intended to be made here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>after.
The preparations for the marriage would be
stated at £27,000 for jewels and plate; and £25,000
for finishing Carlton House. The jointure of the
Princess of Wales, he proposed to be £50,000 a year,
being no more than had been granted on a similar
occasion.'</p>

<p>The addition to the Prince's income was carried by
241 to 100.</p>

<p>In the course of the debate Pitt proposed that the
revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall and part of the
income of £125,000 should be applied to the payment
of the interest of the debts, and to the gradual discharge
of the principal; that the sum so taken should
be vested in the hands of Commissioners. From the
income of £125,000 a year he should propose that
£25,000 should be deducted annually for the payment
of the debts at 4 per cent., and that the revenues of the
Duchy of Cornwall should be appropriated as a sinking
fund, at compound interest, to discharge the principal
of the debts, which they would do in twenty-seven years.</p>

<p>Finally, by an Act which received the royal assent
on June 27, 1795 (35 Geo. III., c. 129), £60,000 per
annum was to be set apart and vested with Commissioners
from the Prince's income, as well as £13,000 per annum
from the Duchy of Cornwall, to pay the Prince's debts,
a proceeding which found small favour in Florizel's
sight.</p>

<p>Of the wretched marriage nothing need be said.
Public appearances were kept up until the birth of the
Princess Charlotte, and the Prince and his consort
visited Brighton together, as we see from the following
extracts from the <cite>Sussex Weekly Advertiser</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p><i>June 22, 1795.</i>&mdash;'Their Royal Highnesses the Prince
and Princess of Wales arrived at Brighton between one
and two o'clock on Thursday morning last. They
alighted at the house of Mr. Hamilton, on the Steine,
which is to be made the Royal residence, till the alterations
that are going forward at the Pavilion, can be
completed.</p>

<p>'In the evening the whole town was illuminated, in
honour of their Royal Highnesses' arrival; but the
effect of the illumination was greatly lessened by the
wetness of the night, as it prevented the lamps with
which the Castle, the Libraries, and other houses were
decorated, from burning.</p>

<p>'The Prince, we are informed, perambulated the
town, in his great coat, to view the different devices.</p>

<p>'Though the untowardness of the weather has,
hitherto, obscured the beauties of Brighton from the
Princess of Wales, it has had no effect whatever on her
Royal Highness's spirits; on the contrary, her cheerfulness
and pleasantry strongly bespeak her approbation
of the place.</p>

<p>'The Prince, about noon yesterday, set off for town,
but we understand his Royal Highness signified his
intention of returning to Brighton some time in the
course of this day.</p>

<p>'On Wednesday morning, should the weather prove
favourable, the Prince and Princess of Wales intend
visiting the Camp, when the whole line will be drawn
up, and fire a Royal salute, on the occasion. After
which, there will be a grand field day.'</p>

<p><i>June 29.</i>&mdash;'The Prince and Princess of Wales did
not visit the Camp, last Wednesday, as was expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
owing to the absence of his Royal Highness, who, on
that day, went to town, in order to attend the Privy
Council. The whole line was, nevertheless, out, and
had a field day.</p>

<p>'On Saturday morning, however, their Royal Highnesses
honoured the Camp with their promised visit,
when the whole line was drawn up in readiness to
receive them; after which, the troops marched to Goldstone
Bottom, where they had a very grand field day,
and fired a Royal salute, on the occasion.</p>

<p>'We are glad to hear, from the best authority, that
the air of Brighton proves extremely agreeable to the
above illustrious Princess. Since her arrival at that
place, her Royal Highness has enjoyed an excellent flow
of spirits, and has frequently been heard to declare she
had never before experienced so good an appetite. Her
Royal Highness has signified her intention of continuing
at Brighton, the whole of the summer.'</p>

<p><i>July 6.</i>&mdash;'The Prince and Princess of Wales removed
from Mr. Hamilton's house, on the Steine, to the Royal
Pavilion, on Thursday last.'</p>

<p>They stopped at Brighton till November, and Queen
Caroline never again revisited it, as, after the birth of
the Princess Charlotte (January 7, 1796), the royal
couple separated for good.</p>

<p>The Prince went to Brighton for the season on
July 28, 1796, and the Pavilion, as it then was, is thus
described in a contemporary pamphlet:<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>'The Pavilion is built principally of wood; it is a
nondescript monster in building, and appears like a mad
house, or a house run mad, as it has neither beginning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
middle, nor end; yet, to acquire this design, a miserable
bricklayer was despatched to Italy, to gather something
equal to the required magnificence, and actually charged
two thousand guineas for his expenses.&mdash;There are four
pillars in <em>scagliola</em>, in a sort of oven, where the Prince
dines; and, when the fire is lighted, the room is so hot,
that the parties are nearly baked and incrusted: the
ground on which it is erected was given to the Prince
by the town, for which he allows them fifty pounds
yearly, to purchase grog and tobacco; and has so far
mended their ways, as to make a common sewer to hold
the current filth of the parish.'</p>

<p>The same pamphlet contains 'A Moral Epistle from
the Pavilion at Brighton to Carlton House, London,'
which gives an account of the style of company kept
there:</p>

<p>We learn what the society at Brighton was like at
this time by the following excerpt from the <cite>Times</cite> of
July 13, 1796:</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Brighton.</span>&mdash;The Prince and Princess of <span class="smcap">Wales's</span>
arrival has been talked of much in London; but, as
yet, we have no signs of it here. The Duke and Duchess
of <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> pass their time in a very retired manner
indeed. His Grace walked for some time yesterday
evening upon the <em>Steyne</em>; the company consisted chiefly
of opulent Jews, needy fortune hunters, broken down
Cyprians, fishermen's daughters, and several fat city
dowdies, from the environs of Norton Folgate. Her
Grace commands the play on Friday evening, which will
be her <em>first appearance</em> in public, here, for this season.
The Officers of the Blues are the <em>great dashers</em> of the
place; they associate with no one but their own Corps.
The most of them keep their blood horses, their curricles,
and their girls. At one o'clock they appear on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
parade, to hear the word of command given to the
Subaltern Guard: afterwards, they toss off their <em>goes</em>
of brandy, dine about five, and come about eight to
the Theatre. <i lang="fr">Vivent L'Amour et Bacchus.</i>'</p>

<p>The latter part of this quotation seems to be borne
out by the first of '<span class="smcap">Twelve Golden Rules</span> <em>for young
Gentlemen of Distinction, to be observed at Brighton for
the year 1796</em>':</p>

<p>'Young and inexperienced officers must confederate
with several of their mess, as young as themselves, and
reel into the theatre, during the performance, in a state
of assumed intoxication, and be sure to disturb the
audience in the most important part of the drama, by
taking liberties with any of those Cyprian nymphs who
harbour in the green boxes, and are, unhappily, devoted
to insult: by this manœuvre, if dexterously managed,
they will gain three enormous points;&mdash;the first is, the
credit of having consumed more wine than their income
will allow; the second is, a disposition for unlimited
intrigue; and the third is, an opportunity of displaying
their contempt for good manners, without any hazard
of personal danger.&mdash;This behaviour will be totally out
of character if any of the parties have seen service, or
arrived at the years of discretion.</p>

<p>'N.B.&mdash;All descendants, or members of the tribes of
Israel, must neither mention lottery tickets, <i lang="la">omnium</i>,
<i lang="la">bonus</i>, scrip, navy, nor exchequer bills; they must pay
their tradesmen on Saturdays, laugh at the paschal, eat
swine, and shave every day.'</p>

<p>Let us look at Brighton as shown us by a contemporary
publication<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>'There are two taverns, namely, the Castle, and the
Old Ship, where the richer visitors resort; and, at each
of these houses, a weekly assembly is held, where a
master of the ceremonies attends, to arrange the parties,
not according to the scale of morality, but that of aristocracy.
There is a ball every Monday at the Castle,
and, on Thursdays, at the Old Ship; every subscriber
pays three shillings and sixpence, and every non-subscriber,
five shillings; for which they are entitled to a
beverage which they call <em>tea</em> and <em>coffee</em>.&mdash;The masters
of the respective inns receive the profits, except on
those nights appointed for the benefit of the Master of
the Ceremonies; to whom, all who wish to be arranged
as people of distinction, subscribe one guinea&mdash;and who
would not purchase distinction at so cheap a rate!&mdash;Independently
of this vain <i lang="fr">douceur</i>, they must pay most
liberally for their tickets! The card assemblies are on
Wednesdays and Fridays.&mdash;There is a hotel, which was
intended for a country Hummums, or grand dormitory;
but, in my weak opinion, the establishment is somewhat
inefficient, unless it can be supposed that the
tumultuous equipment of stage coaches, at the dawn of
day, is contributory to the purposes of rest.&mdash;There is a
theatre, commodious, and, generally, well directed; the
nights of performance are Tuesdays and Wednesdays,
Fridays and Saturdays.&mdash;At the lower end of North
Street is a sort of Birmingham Vauxhall, called the
<em>Promenade Grove</em>; it is a small inclosure of a paddock,
tormented from its native simplicity, befringed with a
few gawky poplars, and decorated with flowers, bowers,
zigzag alleys, a ditch, and a wooden box for the
minstrels.&mdash;The coast is like the greater part of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
visitors, bold, saucy, intrusive, and dangerous.&mdash;The
bathing machines, even for the ladies, have no awning,
or covering, as at Weymouth, Margate, and Scarborough;
consequently, they are all severely inspected
by the aid of telescopes, not only as they confusedly
ascend from the sea, but as they kick and sprawl and
flounder about its muddy margin, like so many mad
Naiads in flannel smocks;&mdash;the shore is so disastrously
imperfect, that those beginners who paddle in, are
injured by the shocking repulsion of the juices to the
brain; and, of those who are enabled to plunge in, and
swim beyond the surge, it is somewhat less than an
even bet, that many never return&mdash;in truth, the loss of
lives here, every season, would make any society miserable,
who were not congregating in the mart of noisy
folly.&mdash;There is a Subscription House, or Temple of
Fortune, on the Steyne, where the minor part of our
blessed nobility are accustomed to reduce their characters
and their estates in the same period;&mdash;the signal for
admission is <i lang="la">habeo</i>,&mdash;for rejection, <i lang="la">debeo</i>.&mdash;There are
lodgings of all descriptions and fitness, from twenty
pounds per week, on the Cliffs, to half a crown per
night in a stable&mdash;the keepers of the lodging houses,
like the keepers of madhouses, having but one common
point in view&mdash;to <em>bleed</em> the parties sufficiently.&mdash;There
are carriages and caravans of all shapes and dimensions,
from a waggon to a fish cart; in which you may move
like a king, a criminal, or a crab, that is, forwards,
backwards, or laterally.&mdash;There are two libraries on the
Steyne, replete with every flimsy species of novels,
involving the prodigious intrigues of an imaginary
society; this kind of recreation is termed <em>light reading</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
perhaps, from the certain effect it has upon the brains
of my young country women, of making them <em>light
headed</em>!&mdash;There is a parish church, where the <i lang="fr">canaille</i>
go to pray; but, as this is on a hill, and the gentry
found their Sabbath visit to the Almighty very troublesome,
the amiable and accommodating <em>master</em> priest has
consigned the care of his common <em>parish mutton</em> to his
<em>journeyman</em>, the curate, and has kindly raised a Chapel
Royal for the <em>lambs of fashion</em>, where a certain sum is
paid for every seat; and this, it must be admitted, is
as it should be; as a well bred Deity will, assuredly,
be more attentive to a reclining Duchess, parrying the
assaults of the devil, behind her fan, than the vulgar
piety of a plebeian on his knees.&mdash;There were books
open in the circulating libraries, where you were
requested to contribute your mite of charity to the
support of the rector, as his income is somewhat less
than seven hundred pounds a year; the last incumbent
died worth thirty thousand pounds.'</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IT was in this year that the separation of
the Prince and the titular Princess of
Wales was complete, and Florizel's heart
(if he had such a thing) went back to
his wife. Let us hear Lord Stourton's
account of their reconciliation:</p>

<p>'When she thought her connection with the Prince
was broken off for ever, by his second union, she was
placed by him in difficulties from the same earnest and
almost desperate pursuit, as she had been exposed to
during the first interval of his attachment. Numbers
of the Royal Family, both male and female, urged a
reconciliation, even upon a principle of duty.</p>

<p>'However, as she was, by his marriage with Queen
Caroline, placed in a situation of much difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
involving her own conscience, and making it doubtful
whether public scandal might not interfere with her
own engagements, she determined to resort to the
highest authorities of her own Church upon a case of
such extraordinary intricacy. The Rev. Mr. Nassau,
one of the chaplains of Warwick Street Chapel, was,
therefore, selected to go to Rome and lay the case
before that tribunal, upon the express understanding
that, if the answer should be favourable, she would
again join the Prince; if otherwise, she was determined
to abandon the country. In the meantime, whilst the
negotiation was pending, she obtained a promise from
his Royal Highness that he would not follow her into
her retreat in Wales, where she went to a small bathing
place. The reply from Rome, in a Brief, which, in a
moment of panic, she destroyed, fearful of the consequences
during Mr. Percival's administration, was
favourable to the wishes of the Prince; and, faithful
to her own determination to act, as much as possible,
in the face of the public, she resisted all importunities
to meet him clandestinely. The day on which she
joined him again at her own house, was the same on
which she gave a public breakfast to the whole town of
London, and to which he was invited.</p>

<p>'She told me, she hardly knew how she could summon
resolution to pass that severe ordeal, but she thanked
God she had the courage to do so. The next eight
years were, she said, the happiest of her connection
with the Prince. She used to say that they were
extremely poor, but as merry as crickets; and, as a
proof of their poverty, she told me that once, on their
returning to Brighton from London, they mustered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
their common means, and could not raise £5 between
them. Upon this, or some such occasion, she related
to me, that an old and faithful servant endeavoured to
force them to accept £60, which he said he had accumulated
in the service of the best of Masters and Mistresses.
She added, however, that even this period, the happiest
of their lives, was much embittered by the numerous
political difficulties which frequently surrounded the
Prince.'</p>

<p>We can scarcely, nowadays, when the judicial separation
of man and wife is an everyday occurrence, and
divorce is rendered as easy as possible, properly conceive
Mrs. Fitzherbert's feelings in this matter of reconciliation.
We must, however, remember that she was a
strict Catholic, that her Church teaches that marriage
is indissoluble, except by death, and that she invoked
and followed the highest ecclesiastical authorities for
guidance. Let us hear a modern opinion of her conduct.
It occurs in the <cite>Dublin Review</cite> of October, 1854, p. 21,
in a criticism of 'Lord Holland's Memoirs':</p>

<p>'The doctrine of the Catholic Church regarding
marriage is plain and simple. She teaches that the
marriage contract itself, which is perfected by the
words, "I take thee for my wife," on the part of the
man, and "I take thee for my husband," on the part
of the woman, or by any other words, or signs, by
which the contracting parties manifest their intention
of taking each other for man and wife, is a sacrament.
Protestants are apt to fall into the mistake that it is
the priest who administers the sacrament to the wedded
pair. He does no such thing. As far as the validity
of the contract and of the sacrament is concerned, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
when the contracting parties are both Catholics, the
priest need not utter a word. His presence is only
necessary as a <em>witness</em> to the contract between the
parties. Up to the time of the Council of Trent, the
presence of a priest was not necessary for the validity
of either the contract, or the sacrament. Nor was it
by any means to confer the sacrament that the Council
enacted a law requiring his presence. The law was
made in consequence of the abuses which arose from
clandestine marriages, because an immoral person who
had married without witnesses, could, afterwards, deny
the existence of the contract, and wed another publicly,
and in the face of the Church. To prevent this abuse,
the Council of Trent enacted that the parish priest of
one of the contracting parties, or some other priest
deputed by him, and two other witnesses should, <em>for
the future</em> (<i lang="la">in posterum</i>), be present (<i lang="la">præsente parocho</i>)
at the marriage contract. The presence of the two
other witnesses is required exactly in the same way as
that of the parish priest. The law is simply that
marriage should be contracted in the presence of three
witnesses, one of whom should, necessarily, be the parish
priest.</p>

<p>'Nor was this law made, at once, obligatory, even on
Catholics. By an ordinance of the Council, it was not
to have effect <em>in any parish</em> until thirty days after it
had been published there. This allowed a large discretion
to each bishop with regard to the time of its
publication in his diocese, and, in fact, it is not long
since it has been introduced into England.</p>

<p>'But it does not, and never did apply to any marriage
in these countries, where one of the parties is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Catholic. Neither in such marriages, which are called
mixed, nor in those contracted between parties, neither
of whom belong to the Catholic Church, is the presence
of any priest required for the validity of either the
contract, or sacrament. It is not even necessary that
the contracting parties should <em>know</em> that marriage is a
sacrament. The sacrament exists wherever Christians
marry as Christ intended; and, if they be properly
disposed, they will receive grace to live happily together,
and to bring up their children in the fear and love of God.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Fitzherbert's marriage was, therefore, perfectly
valid, both as a contract and as a sacrament, in the eyes
of the whole Catholic Church, and to imagine that she
alone, of all those who professed the same faith, should
look upon it as invalid, is monstrously absurd. Neither
the Pope, nor the whole Church could have annulled it,
nor allowed her to marry another.</p>

<p>'But it was illegal! Why, so was the whole Catholic
religion, at the same period. It was, not very long ago,
unlawful to celebrate Mass, but the sacrifice was not,
therefore, invalidly offered. To say that Mrs. Fitzherbert
considered the marriage ceremony to be nonsense,
because it was illegal, at the time when the penal code
against Catholics&mdash;and especially that part of it which
regarded matrimony&mdash;was in full operation, is about
as reasonable, as to prove that she did not believe in
transubstantiation, because the law declared it to be
damnable and idolatrous.'</p>

<p>For the next two or three years we hear little about
the Prince, the newspapers leaving his doings unrecorded.
We learn (May 15, 1797) that 'On last Thursday evening,
the Prince of Wales, accompanied by a single gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>man,
arrived at his Pavilion at Brighton. His Royal
Highness, the next day, reviewed the Monmouth and
Brecon Militia, on the Downs, near the above place.
To-day, we hear, the Prince leaves Brighton, having
come there only for a few days, by the advice of
Dr. Warren, for the benefit of the sea air. His Royal
Highness has lost much of his corpulence since he was
last at Brighton.'</p>

<p>He went again, on July 24, to be present at the races,
and it is recorded that, on October 23, 'The Prince of
Wales amused himself with a day's shooting at Petworth,
on an invitation from the Earl of Egremont. The next
day, his Royal Highness being on his way to London,
with post horses, very narrowly escaped being overturned,
about a mile and a half on the other side of Cuckfield,
where the horses, by some means, took the carriage off
the main road to the side of a bank, and with an inclination
that threatened its overturn, for the space of
many yards, but fortunately, and owing to the lowness
of the carriage, it was kept upon its wheels.'</p>

<p>He was present at the races on August 1, 2, and 3,
1798, and a newspaper remarks that 'The change of
society and manners which has taken place at the
Pavilion, gives the most heartfelt satisfaction to every
lover of his country; it is, now, every way worthy of
the Heir apparent of the British Empire.'</p>

<p>In 1799 we hear of him being at Brighton, both in
July and October. In 1800 he was at the races in
August, when his horse Knowsley won a race. In the
'Brighton New Guide,' fourth edition, there is a good
view of the Pavilion as it was in 1800, with the following
text:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>'Adjoining to Marlborough House stands the <span class="smcap">Marine
Pavilion</span>, built by his Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales, in the year 1784.</p>

<p>'This handsome structure extends upwards of 200 feet
in front, towards the Steyne; the centre is a circular
building, with a lofty dome, supported by pillars; on
each side are two elegant rooms on the ground floor,
with bed chambers over them: in addition to these, in
the spring of 1802, two wings were added, which gives
a light, airy appearance to the building; gravel walks,
grass plats, and plantations towards the Steyne, add a
great degree of elegance to the whole.</p>

<p>'The front, towards the street, forms a square, with
a handsome colonnade in the middle, supported by
columns; in the wings are commodious apartments for
his Royal Highness's suite; in the court is the figure of
a negro supporting a dial, executed in a superior style
of beautiful sculpture.'</p>

<p>The Prince was at Brighton in 1801. <i lang="la">Vide</i> the
following extract from a newspaper:</p>

<p>'<em>Rejoicings for Peace.</em> <i>Oct. 14.</i>&mdash;On Monday, the
joyful tidings of Peace were celebrated here; the bells
rang from six in the morning till twelve at night; never
was the satisfaction of the people more fully displayed.
Young and old wore ribbons emblematic of the occasion&mdash;<em>Peace
and Plenty!</em> The sea fencibles fired a <i lang="fr">feu de joie</i>,
marched from thence to the Prince's house, and gave
him three loud huzzas: with that liberality which has
ever marked our Royal guest, he ordered them two
hogsheads of beer. Brilliant illuminations took place
in the evening; the whole town appeared in a blaze.
The most distinguished were those of his Royal High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>ness
the Prince of Wales, flambeaux burning round his
house, and every window lighted. This happy day
closed with a ball and supper at the Castle, attended
by near five hundred visitors; at one o'clock the room
was opened with the most sumptuous entertainment;
every delicacy that could be procured.'</p>

<p>The Prince was in Brighton in 1802, and in the
latter part of the year hunted almost daily with his
harriers, and had concerts at the Pavilion two or three
times a week. He left it for the season on December 27.</p>

<p>A newspaper cutting tells us that 'The charitable
donations and willing assistance which Mrs. Fitzherbert
has bestowed, and continues to bestow on the unfortunate
individuals of this place, have justly endeared
her to the inhabitants of every description.'</p>

<p>But the miserable caricaturist, who knew nothing of
her noble nature, depicts her in a scurrilous drawing
(October 21, 1802), entitled <span class="smcap">'A Brighton Breakfast,
or Morning Comforts</span>.' Mrs. Fitzherbert and Lady Lade
are at breakfast; Mrs. Fitzherbert is pouring Hollands
into a huge tumbler labelled 'Comfort,' and says,
'Won't you take another Comforter? We must make
haste, I expect Noodle here presently.' Lady Lade,
who takes Brandy, says, 'I think your Comforters are
bigger than my John's.'</p>

<p>The next day brought out another satirical print,
indicative of the Prince's intimacy with the Lades. It
is called 'Birds of a Feather Flock Together; Diversions
of Brighton.' Sir John Lade and the Prince are on the
box of an open carriage, in which are seated Mrs. Fitzherbert
and a lady (Miss Snow). Sir John is lashing
one of the four horses, and says to the Prince, 'There,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
B&mdash;&mdash;t it, don't you see? that's the Cut.' Miss Snow
observes to Mrs. Fitzherbert, 'Did Noodle bring your
physic this morning?' To which she replies, 'Oh, yes,
he calls regularly every morning.'</p>

<p>We read in the <cite>Sussex Weekly Advertiser</cite> (February 28,
1803) that 'The Prince's Pavilion at Brighton is undergoing
other considerable alterations and improvement,
under the direction of Mr. Holland, the architect;
and is ordered to be got ready for the residence of
his Royal Highness, at an early part of the ensuing
season.'</p>

<p>On October 14, 1800, just before Weltje died, the
Prince took from him a lease of the Pavilion for ninety-nine
years at a rent, annually, of £1,150, and on
April 18, 1803, he went to Brighton to see how the
alterations were getting on. 'His Royal Highness
slept at the house, late Weltje's, adjoining the Pavilion,
the repairs and alterations of which are not yet completed.
The Prince, after minutely inspecting the
works going on, returned to town on Thursday.'</p>

<p>In this extravagance he was somewhat justified, for
on February 16 the Chancellor of the Exchequer brought
before the House of Commons the following message
from the King:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">George R.</span></p>

<p>'His Majesty having taken into consideration
the period which has elapsed since the adoption of those
arrangements which were deemed, by the wisdom of
Parliament, to be necessary for the discharge of the
incumbrances of the Prince of Wales; and, having
adverted to the progress which has been made in carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
them into effect, recommends the present situation of
the Prince to the attention of this House.</p>

<p>'Notwithstanding the reluctance and regret which
his Majesty must feel in suggesting any addition to the
burthens of his people, he is induced to resort, in this
instance, to the experienced liberality and attachment
of his faithful Commons, in the persuasion that they
will be disposed to take such measures, as may be
calculated to promote the comfort, and support the
dignity of so distinguished a branch of his Royal Family.'</p></blockquote>

<p>On February 23 the House went into Committee to
consider the King's message; and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer (Addington) pointed out that on the 5th of
the previous January £563,895 had been paid off the
Prince's debt of £650,000, and that the whole would
be discharged in July, 1806. He moved 'That his
Majesty be enabled to grant a yearly sum, or sums of
money, out of the Consolidated Fund of Great Britain,
not exceeding, in the whole, the sum of Sixty thousand
pounds; to take place, and be computed from the 5th
day of January, 1803, and to continue until the 5th
day of July, 1806, towards providing for the better
support of the station and dignity of his Royal Highness,
the Prince of Wales.' This resolution was agreed to.</p>

<p>In September, 1803, the royal stables, now the
Dome, were commenced, and that the Prince was there
in October we have evidence in the following newspaper
cutting:</p>

<p>'<i>Oct. 2.</i>&mdash;The Prince of Wales, at the conclusion
of the Concert at the Pavilion, some time after midnight,
on Thursday last, addressing himself to Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Leigh, expressed an anxious desire to know in how
short a time his regiment of dragoons could be under
arms, and ready to face the enemy, should necessity
require their exertions in the night. The Colonel immediately
proposed, as the best method of satisfying his
Royal Highness, instantly to ride to, and order an
alarm to be sounded at the barracks; and, afterwards,
to return, and give his Royal Highness a correct
account of the conduct of his troops. This measure
being approved by the Prince, the Colonel's horse was
soon brought to the door, and he set off, with all
possible speed to see it carried into effect.</p>

<p>'On reaching the advanced guard at the entrance of
the barracks, the Colonel commanded a black trumpeter
on duty, to sound to arms. The man, in obedience to
the mandate, raised the trumpet to his lips; but the
surprise of the moment so greatly overpowered him,
that he wanted breath to put it in execution. An
English trumpeter, who overheard the order, as he lay
in bed, in an instant arose, dashed open the window of
his room, and without waiting for further advice, put
the bugle to his mouth, gave the proper signal, and the
troops, in every part, were, in an instant, in motion.
The greater part of the soldiers had been in bed many
hours; the whole of them were properly accoutred, and
on their horses, together with the flying artillery, in
readiness to depart, in time sufficient to have reached
Brighton within 15 minutes after the bugle gave the
alarm. The barracks are situated something better
than a mile and a half to the north of the town.'</p>

<p>The following excerpt from the <em>Annual Register</em>
shows the diversions of Brighton:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>Aug. 20, 1803.</i>&mdash;A whimsical exhibition took
place on the race ground at Brighton. Captain Otto,
of the Sussex Militia, booted, and mounted by a
grenadier of 18 stone weight, was matched to run 50
yards, against a poney, carrying a feather, to run 150;
but Capt. Otto's rider tumbled over his neck, which he
was very near cracking; and, consequently, he lost the
bet. The next match was, the same gentleman,
mounted by the same grenadier, to run 50 yards,
against a noble lord, carrying a feather, who was to run
100. He was considerably distanced by the latter.'</p>

<p>The following is taken from the <cite>Times</cite> of September 7,
1804:</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Brighton Anecdote.</span>&mdash;Some ill timed pleasantry
was played off, a few days ago, at Brighton, on a
respectable <em>Law Officer</em> and his wife, who have made a
summer excursion there. An invitation, couched in
due form, and bearing all the marks of authenticity,
was sent to them, desiring their company at the Pavilion
in the evening. The Gentleman and Lady, justly proud
of the distinguished honour thus conferred on them,
they knew not how, attended at the hour appointed,
and were ushered into the Saloon, in which were
many persons of distinction, to whom they were wholly
unknown. Some embarrassment necessarily ensued, but
it was increased to a ten fold degree, when they were
announced to the <em>illustrious</em> Master of the house, who
had no recollection either of his guests, or the invitation
in his name; an explanation ensued, and his Royal
Highness, with all that urbanity that distinguishes him
as the most finished Gentleman in Europe, was pleased
to declare "that he felt himself much indebted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
ingenious person, who (by forging his invitation, in
order, perhaps, to sport with their feelings) had afforded
him the pleasure of their society and acquaintance,
however unexpected; and that he was perfectly happy
in the opportunity of receiving them." His Royal
Highness conducted himself towards them during the
whole of the evening with the most liberal and marked
attention, and thus converted a <em>rencontre</em>, which was produced
by the most malignant motives, into a source of
honour and perfect satisfaction.'</p>

<p>Of the Prince's connection with Brighton in 1804 we
have very little trace. He was averse to having his
doings chronicled, probably because they were immediately
pictorially satirized; but we have a very fine
one by Gillray, called <span class="smcap">The Reconciliation</span>, published
on November 20, 1804.</p>

<p>The Prince and the King had been at daggers drawn,
principally as to the guardianship of the little Princess
Charlotte. A peace was temporarily patched up between
them, and the King wrote on November 7 to the Chancellor
that he was ready to receive the Prince. The
letter being forwarded to the latter, he at once replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
'<span class="smcap">Brighton</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
'<em>Nov. 8, 1804</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>'The Prince of Wales, without delay, acknowledges
the receipt of the Chancellor's letter; and will, in consequence
of the gracious intention signified from his
Majesty, be in London to-morrow evening, with Lord
Moira, who has just arrived at Brighthelmstone. The
Earl of Moira is authorised by the Prince to wait upon
the Chancellor at any hour on Saturday morning, that
his lordship may please to appoint.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>The meeting between father and son took place on
November 12, and next day the King wrote to the
Princess of Wales:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
'<span class="smcap">Windsor Castle</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
'<em>Nov. 13, 1804</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">My dearest Daughter in Law, and Niece</span>,</p>

<p>'Yesterday, I and the rest of the family had an
interview with the Prince of Wales, at Kew. Care was
taken on all sides to avoid all subjects of altercation,
or explanation, consequently, the conversation was
neither instructive, nor entertaining; but it leaves
the Prince of Wales in a situation to show whether
his desire to return to the family, is only verbal, or
real, which time, alone, can prove. I am not idle in
my endeavours to make inquiries that may enable me
to communicate some plan for the advantage of the
dear child. You and I, with so much reason, must
interest ourselves; and its effecting my having the
happiness of living more with you, is no small incentive
to my forming some ideas on the subject, but you may
depend on their not being decided upon, without your
thorough and cordial concurrence; for your authority
as a mother, it is my object to support.</p>


<p class="ps4">'Believe me, at all times,</p>
<p class="ps6">'My dearest daughter and niece,</p>
<p class="ps2">'Your most affectionate Father in Law and Uncle,</p>
<p class="ps16">'<span class="smcap">George R.</span>'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing really came of this so-called 'Reconciliation,'
and soon father and son were as much estranged
as ever. Gillray gives us a picture of the Prodigal
Son's return. '<em>And he arose and came to his Father;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and his Father saw him, and had compassion and ran,
and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</em>' The Prince of
Wales is in tatters, with his empty pockets turned
inside out, his stockings slipping down, and his shoes
down at heel. Lord Moira and Pitt stand by, looking
on, and Queen Charlotte, with her arms outspread, and
two of the Princesses, are beaming with delight.</p>

<p>The case of Miss Seymour&mdash;Satirical prints thereon&mdash;The
Prince at Brighton, 1806&mdash;His birthday&mdash;The Green Man&mdash;Visit
of the Princess Charlotte.</p></div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN 1805 the Prince was much at Brighton,
but we hear but little of him except
in connection with Mrs. Fitzherbert's
guardianship of Miss Mary Seymour,
a child of whom the Prince of Wales
was very fond, and Lord Stourton tells the story in a
pleasant way:</p>

<p>'A circumstance now took place, which ended by
blasting all her happy prospects, and, finally, terminated
in a rupture with the Prince, which lasted till the end
of his life. One of the dearest friends of Mrs. Fitzherbert,
Lady Horatia Seymour, in the last stage of
decline, was advised to go abroad, to seek, in change of
climate, her only chance of recovery. She had, at that
time, an infant, and, not being able to take it with her,
she entrusted her treasure to the care of her attached
friend, Mrs. Fitzherbert, who, having no child of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
own, soon became devotedly attached to the precious
child, and her affection for the child increased with the
loss of the parent. Some time afterwards, one of the
near relatives of the family, desirous of having the
education of the child placed in other hands, and being
jealous of the religion of its protectress, applied to the
Chancellor to obtain possession of Miss Seymour, as
guardian. Mrs. Fitzherbert, now more than ever
devoted to the child, and sharing, in this affection,
with the Prince himself, exerted every means to retain
the custody of it; and, after all others had failed, had,
at last, recourse to Lady Hertford, with whom she was,
formerly, intimately acquainted. She requested her to
intercede with Lord Hertford, as head of his house,
to come to her aid; and, demanding for himself the
guardianship of the child, to give it up to her,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> upon
certain conditions as to its education.'</p>

<p>The satirical prints, of course, were to the fore on
this subject, although it was a purely private matter.
First of all comes (January 9, 1805) '<span class="smcap">To Be, or Not
to Be, a Protestant</span>.' Miss Seymour is sitting on a
sofa, holding in her hand a book, '<em>Mother's advice to
her Daughter, respecting the true principles of the Protestant
religion</em>'; Mrs. Fitzherbert, wearing a rosary
and crucifix, and having in her hand a book, '<em>Directions
from the clergy, respecting the Duty of a true Catholic,
in converting all, etc.</em>,' says: 'I say I have the undoubted
right to have the care of her, and to bring her
up as I like. Do I not Rule the Roast?' At an open
door appears a monk, who says: 'Well done, my Child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
you are now serving our holy religion; you shall next
use your influence to procure us Emancipation.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="THE_GUARDIAN_ANGEL"></a>
<img src="images/i_211fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE GUARDIAN ANGEL.</div>
</div>


<p>'<span class="smcap">The Convention, or a Hint at Emancipation</span>,' is
another on the same subject (February 18, 1805).
Mrs. Fitzherbert, who has been reading 'The Reign
of Queen Mary,' is seated at a table with a monk, who
is making a hearty meal of roast beef and port wine.
She says: 'Oh, Father, they want to rob me of my
charge, I will not part with her; entrusted to my care,
I have the will and the power to make her as mine
own, and save one Heretic, at least. I know my power,
and will exert it for our cause.' Says the monk: 'Dear
Child! the labours of the faithful claim their due
regard. That thou hast laboured to promote our
cause, full well I know, and have my brethren well
informed. Emancipation is at hand, and all <em>depends
on thee</em>.'</p>

<p>But the best print is '<span class="smcap">The Guardian Angel</span>. The
print taken from the Rev. Mr. Peter's sublime Idea of
an Angel conducting the Soul of a Child to Heaven.'
Mrs. Fitzherbert, with an apron full of 'play things,'
such as rosaries, monstrances, thuribles, service-books,
etc., is the angel, who, ascending from the Pavilion at
Brighton, with Miss Seymour in her arms, points to an
altar surrounded by lighted candles, flowers, etc., and
surmounted by a Virgin and Child. All round are
cherubs&mdash;Fox, Sheridan, Earl of Derby, etc., all friends
of the Prince.</p>

<p>We learn the following from a newspaper cutting in
1805:</p>

<p>'On Friday and Saturday, the Prince, attended by
Col. Leigh and Col. Hanger, rode for several hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Soon after six o'clock, on the former evening, his Royal
Highness, in his carriage, left the Pavilion to dine with
the Marchioness of Downshire, at Westfield Lodge.
Among the <em>elegantes</em> present, on this occasion, were,
Lord and Lady Harrington, the beautiful and accomplished
Lady Ann Maria Stanhope, Mrs. Fitzherbert,
Baron Eben, Col. Hanger, Col. Leigh, etc., forming, on
the whole, a select and sociable party of fourteen.
About nine o'clock, the Prince, the Marchioness, and
the whole of her guests from Westfield Lodge, removed
to the Pavilion, where a most splendid entertainment,
consisting of a ball and supper, etc., was given by the
Prince, and of which the greater part of the most distinguished
persons, here at present, partook, in number
somewhat exceeding one hundred and sixty.... On
the night following (Saturday) it being the natal day
of the interesting little <em>protégée</em> of Mrs. Fitzherbert,
Miss Seymour, this young lady gave a ball and supper
to a party of juvenile nobility, at the Pavilion.'</p>

<p>The Prince's birthday in 1806 was celebrated at
Brighton with great festivity.</p>

<p>'<i>Aug. 12.</i>&mdash;At the Pavilion dinner yesterday, the
Prince entertained five of his Royal brothers, the Dukes
of York, Clarence, Kent, Sussex, and Cumberland. Of
the splendid party were also the Duke of Orleans,
M. Beaujolais, the Marquis of Winchester, Count
Stahremberg, Mr. Sheridan, Colonels Turner and Lee,
etc. This being the natal day of the Heir apparent,
the morning was ushered in by the ringing of bells, and
the flag was hoisted on the tower of the church. Two
oxen, <em>pro bono publico</em>, are roasting whole, on the Level.
Such an agreeable bustle as this town at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
exhibits, was never witnessed here before. Business
is totally given up, and pleasure is the standing order
of the day. At ten o'clock a.m., the <em>Otter</em> sloop of
war, decorated with the colours of all nations, hoisted
the Royal Standard at the main, and announced the
event by a discharge of her guns. The <em>Gallant</em> and
<em>Calypso</em>, armed brigs, and Earl Craven's yacht, were,
also, dressed out with colours. About this time, the
Carabineers from Shoreham, and the Fourth Dragoons,
passed to the north and south of the town for the
Downs. The Artillery, the King's Dragoons, and the
Nottingham and South Gloucestershire Militias were
under arms as early as four o'clock in the morning.
At half past twelve, the Prince of Wales, habited as a
Field Marshal, a star at his breast, accompanied by his
Royal brothers, and a numerous suite of noblemen,
etc., and mounted on a grey charger, splendidly caparisoned,
left the Pavilion for the Downs. The Royal
brothers were all in regimentals, with stars at their
breasts. The Duke of Sussex wore his Highland
uniform. The Earl of Moira, General White, Count
Beaujolais, Lord E. Somerset, the Earl of Barrymore,
etc., were in the Prince's suite. Lady Haggerstone,
and Miss Seymour, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Headfort,
Mr. Sheridan, and Mrs. Smith were in the Prince's
landau. Mrs. Fitzherbert was detained at home by
indisposition.</p>

<p>'As soon as the Royal cavalcade was distinguished by
the military on the Downs, signal guns were discharged,
and every necessary adjustment was, in an instant, made
for its reception. The Royal party now advanced, and
passed down the centre of the line, each regiment saluting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and the bands alternately playing "God save the King."
Having reached the extremity of the line, the cavalcade
turned back, and the Commander in Chief and staff,
took their stations in the centre of the line, the Prince
and the other Royal Dukes facing them. The whole
line now saluted the Prince. This ended, the line passed
the Prince, in review order, to slow time; the bands of
each regiment wheeling off, and playing until the regiment
to which they were attached, had gone by. The
regiments again passed in quick time, the Duke of York,
etc., having stationed themselves by the Prince of Wales.
The line was again formed, when a <em>feu de joie</em> was fired
in a very capital style. Huzzas and "God save the King"
concluded the proceedings, this day, on the hill, when
a signal was hoisted at the Telegraph, for the shipping
to salute, which was instantly obeyed; and every house
in the town was shaken by the explosion. The Princes
returned to the Pavilion about half past three o'clock.
At six, all the splendour and fashion of Brighton were
assembled to dine at the Pavilion.</p>

<p>'<i>Tuesday Evening.</i>&mdash;The crowd on the Level in
number are many thousands; and his Royal Highness's
butcher, Russell, habited in a white jacket, the sleeves
ornamented with buff and blue ribbons, and a blue sash
containing the words "Long live the Royal Brothers,"
with a white apron, and steel, and a fanciful cap to
correspond, has just given the signal for the grand carver
to do his duty. The acclamations of the multitude are
deafening, and all, now, is confusion, expectation and joy.
The Nottingham Militia, whose encampment adjoins
the public kitchens, are busy actors in this scene. They
distinguish themselves manfully, and many a heavy joint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
after severe struggles for victory, is borne by them,
triumphantly, to their tents. Amongst the splendid
party at the Pavilion are, the six Royal Brothers, the
Lord Chancellor, Earl Moira, Count Beaujolais, Mr.
Sheridan, Mr. Tierney, with a numerous assemblage of
persons, the most distinguished for their rank and
talents. Two bands of music, the Prince's own, and
the South Gloucester, play alternately on the Lawn.
The Steyne is crowded with pedestrians. The town
is generally illuminated; Pollard's and Donaldson's
libraries have, both, a very brilliant appearance. The
Theatre, Fisher's lounge, Mr. Russell's, the Old Ship,
the New Inn, the Coach Offices, Blaker's, Alexander's,
and the greater part of the houses at the bottom of
North Street, are, also, lit up in a very radiant style.</p>

<p>'At ten o'clock, the Princes and the whole of the
Royal dinner party left the Pavilion, for the ball at the
Castle. The rooms had a good show of company as
early as half past eight, but, towards nine, they began
to arrive in crowds. Carriages with four and six horses
rattled through the town from Worthing, Rottingdean,
Lewes and Eastbourne. Before ten o'clock, not less
than four hundred persons were present; and, before
eleven, the assemblage had received an addition of two
hundred, at least. The crowd occasioned heat, and
many ladies nearly fainted, though every possible precaution
was taken to prevent it.</p>

<p>'When the Royal Brothers entered the ball room,
the band (the Prince's) struck up, "God save the King,"
all the company standing until they had passed down
the room. All the rank, elegance, fashion and beauty
in Sussex were present. A few minutes subsequent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the arrival of the Princes, dancing commenced with the
<em>Honey Moon</em>. About fifty couple stood up; who led
off, it was impossible correctly to ascertain. This dance
was succeeded by <em>Lord Macdonald's reel</em>; at the end of
which, about half an hour after midnight, the Prince
and his Royal brothers removed to the supper rooms:
tables were laid in three separate rooms, but the company
was so numerous, that many could not be accommodated
with seats; and, consequently, <em>sans</em> refreshment,
they were compelled to remain in the ball room. The
tables were decorated with every delicacy of the season.
The ladies were dressed in an unusual style of elegance;
such a rich display of diamonds we never saw at a public
entertainment before, and such a fascinating display of
beautiful women, in one house, was not to be found,
perhaps, in any other part of the world. The Princes
were all in regimentals, and all appeared in high health
and spirits. The attention paid by those illustrious
personages to the company was highly flattering. They
entered into conversation with all they knew; and the
ladies were highly gratified with the marked attention
which was so peculiarly bestowed upon them; and all
ultimately retired, highly gratified with the entertainment
they had received.'</p>

<p>My readers must pardon my introducing an episode
unconnected with this book, except as regards Brighton;
but it is so curious that I cannot refrain. It is chronicled
in the <em>Annual Register</em> for 1806:</p>

<p>'<i>Oct. 25.</i>&mdash;Among the personages who lately attracted
public notice at Brighton, was an original, or <em>would be</em>
original, generally known by the appellation of <span class="smcap">The
Green man</span>. He dressed in green pantaloons, green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
waistcoat, green frock, green cravat: and, though his
ears, whiskers, eyebrows, and chin were powdered, his
countenance, no doubt, from the reflection of his clothes,
was also green. He ate nothing but greens, fruits and
vegetables; had his rooms painted green, and furnished
with green sofa, green chairs, green tables, green bed,
and green curtains. His gig, his livery, his portmanteau,
his gloves and his whip were all green. With a green
silk handkerchief in his hand, and a large watch chain
with green seals, fastened to the green buttons of his
green waistcoat, he paraded every day on the Steine.</p>

<p>'This morning, at six o'clock, this gentleman leaped
from the window of his lodging, on the south parade,
into the street, ran thence to the verge of the cliff nearly
opposite, and threw himself over the precipice, to the
beach below. The height of the cliff whence he precipitated
himself, is about 20 feet perpendicular. From
the general demeanour of the above gentleman, it is
supposed he is deranged. His name, we understand, is
Henry Cope, and that he is related to some highly distinguished
families.'</p>

<p>There were some contemporary verses on Mr. Cope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'A spruce little man in a doublet of <em>green</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">Perambulates, daily, the streets and the Steyne.</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Green</em> striped is his waistcoat, his small clothes are <em>green</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">And, oft, round his neck a green 'kerchief is seen.</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Green</em> watch string, green seals, and, for certain, I've heard,</div>
<div class="verse">(Tho' they're powdered) <em>green</em> whiskers, and eke a <em>green</em> beard;</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Green</em> garters, <em>green</em> hose, and, deny it who can,</div>
<div class="verse">The Brains, too, are <em>green</em>, of this little green man.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another account of him says:</p>

<p>'Mr. Cope, at four o'clock, walked on the Steyne;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
he wore a huge cocked hat, with gold tassels. He
was surrounded with company, who expressed their
surprise at the size of his hat: when he answered
that he was then performing a different character
from that of the preceding day. He is the gaze of
Brighton.'</p>

<p>In 1807 the Princess Charlotte was staying at
Worthing, and paid a surprise visit to the good folks
of Brighton.</p>

<p>'<i>July 27.</i>&mdash;About eight o'clock yesterday evening, an
open barouche, with four horses, halted for a few minutes
nearly opposite to the Pavilion, and, shortly afterwards,
it was ascertained that the carriage contained the Princess
Charlotte of Wales. The carriage at length moved for
the Buff and Blue houses, and, afterwards, down the
North and South Parades, followed by an immense
confluence of people, anxious to obtain a view of the
interesting blossom of royalty. As if to gratify the
populace, the carriage moved but slowly, and, on the
North Parade, it again halted for a few moments. Her
Royal Highness was habited in a very plain and simple
style, white frock and slouch straw hat. She appeared
in charming health, and much pleased with the respectful
notice she obtained. Her extreme likeness
to her Royal parent was loudly spoken of, and, on
that subject, there could be but one opinion. Her
Royal Highness, prior to her arrival here, yesterday,
had paid a visit to Lewes. She returned from hence
to Worthing.'</p>

<p>The Prince liked to spend his birthdays at Brighton,
and 1807 was no exception. Here is a contemporary
account of the festivities:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>Aug. 12.</i>&mdash;His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales's
birthday was announced, this morning, by the ringing
of bells, and every demonstration of joy: colours were
hoisted on the church. The gun brig, the Strenuous,
and Earl Craven's boat, were dressed in national colours,
and placed in a situation to be seen from the Pavilion.
By eight o'clock, the whole town was in motion, the
Marine Parade was lined with company, the balconies
were full of beauty and fashion, and all the telescopes
were in use. At ten o'clock, the gun brig fired a royal
salute, which was answered by Earl Craven's boat. His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales's band, in full
uniform, played on the lawn in front of the Pavilion;
and, on the outside of the railing, the carriages formed a
complete line, the ladies sitting on the boxes, surrounded
by a vast number of gentlemen on horseback, viewing
the lawn in front of the Pavilion, where all the Royal
Dukes were walking.</p>

<p>'At eleven o'clock, her Royal Highness the Princess
Charlotte of Wales arrived at the Pavilion from
Worthing, in one of her Royal father's carriages, drawn
by four beautiful bays. Her Royal Highness was dressed
in white muslin, trimmed with point lace, Vandyked at
the edges, and wore a Leghorn gipsy hat, with wreaths
of small roses round the edge of the leaf, and a second
row round the crown. Her Royal Highness looked most
charmingly, and was received at the grand entrance
by her Royal father and uncles, who conducted her
to the Chinese apartment, with which she appeared
greatly delighted. The Pavilion was surrounded on
all sides by a most numerous concourse of spectators,
who waited anxiously to see the Royal party proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to the ground, where the grand review was to take
place.</p>

<p>'At twelve o'clock, a Royal salute was fired from the
batteries; and, immediately after, two of the Royal
carriages came out, the first, drawn by four bays, with
two postilions dressed in blue striped jackets, and
brown beaver hats; in this carriage were Viscount and
Viscountess Melbourne, Lord Erskine, and Mr. Dalmy;
in the second, her Royal Highness, the Princess Charlotte
of Wales, attended by the Dowager Lady De Clifford,
and another lady; the carriage was drawn by six fine
bay horses; after which, followed his Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales, mounted on a beautiful iron grey
charger. His Royal Highness was most superbly dressed
in the hussar uniform, and wore a diamond belt, with a
diamond crown on his breast: the feather in his cap was
most superb, encircled with diamonds round the bottom,
and fixed in a diamond loop: never did we witness his
Royal Highness in better health and spirits. The accoutrements
of his charger were most superb. They
proceeded slowly to the ground, where the troops were
formed in a line, which was on the beautiful hills at
the four mile course, which command a grand view of
the sea.</p>

<p>'At within half a mile from the ground, his Royal
Highness the Duke of York galloped up to the line,
extended upwards of a mile, and passed them without
any form. At half past twelve the whole of the Royal
party arrived on the ground, and took their station in
the centre of the line; her Royal Highness the Princess
Charlotte of Wales's carriage stood just behind her
Royal father. As soon as the party had taken their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
station, a royal salute of twenty one guns was fired from
the horse artillery; the ranks formed into open order,
when the Royal party went down the front of the line,
returned by the rear, and retook their station in the
centre, when the whole of the line passed in ordinary
and quick time, the different bands playing "God save
the King." Some ships passing at the time, received
signals from the telegraph; they immediately fired a
Royal salute, and hoisted a Royal Standard.</p>

<p>'There was, also, a sham fight on the sea with small
boats, which had a very pretty effect. The day was
uncommonly fine, and not one accident occurred to damp
the joy manifested on this happy occasion. A good
deal of mirth was occasioned by the firing, several of
the horses that had been taken from the carriages,
having broken loose, and run in all directions, leaving
many of the company fixed in their carriages until the
horses were caught.</p>

<p>'At half past three the Royal party returned to the
Pavilion, where the Prince of Wales's band was playing
to receive them. Her Royal Highness, the Princess
Charlotte of Wales, after partaking of some refreshments,
walked on the lawn with her Royal uncles, who
seemed to vie with each other in attention to her. The
Duke of Cambridge danced with her on the lawn, and at
six o'clock she returned to Worthing. At eight o'clock
the Royal party, the Duke of St. Albans, the Marquis
of Headford, Earls Berkeley, Craven, Dursley, Bathurst
and Barrymore, Viscount Melbourne, Lords Petersham,
Erskine, and Charles, Edward and Arthur Somerset,
and several military officers, sat down to dinner. The
Pavilion was most brilliantly lighted, and the South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Gloucester band played on the Steyne. The illuminations
were splendid. The Prince attended the ball at
the Castle in the evening, which was crowded with
fashion and beauty, but none of the Royal party joined
in the dance. The supper was of the first description,
but would have been better enjoyed had the company
been less numerous. The Prince retired at an early
hour.'</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t1.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE episode of Miss Seymour indirectly
led to the final separation of the Prince
and Mrs. Fitzherbert, which was mainly
brought about by her false friend, Lady
Hertford. Lord Stourton, speaking of
the Mary Seymour incident, says:</p>

<p>'This long negotiation, in which the Prince was the
principal instrument, led him, at last, to those confidential
relations which, ultimately, gave to Lady Hertford,
an ascendancy over him, superior to that possessed
by Mrs. Fitzherbert herself; and, from a friend, converted
her into a successful rival. Lady Hertford,
anxious for the preservation of her own reputation,
which she was not willing to compromise with the
public, even when she ruled the Prince with the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
absolute sway, exposed Mrs. Fitzherbert, at this time,
to very severe trials, which, at last, almost, as she said,
ruined her health and destroyed her nerves. Attentions
were required from her towards Lady Hertford herself,
even when most aware of her superior influence over
the Prince, and these attentions were extorted by the
menace of taking away her child. To diminish her
apparent influence in public, as well as in private, was
now the object. When at Brighton, the Prince, who
had passed part of his mornings with Mrs. Fitzherbert
on friendly terms at her own house, did not even
notice her in the slightest manner at the Pavilion on
the same evenings, and she, afterwards, understood
that such attentions would have been reported to her
rival.</p>

<p>'She was frequently on the point of that separation
which afterwards took place, but was prevented by the
influence of the Royal Family from carrying her resolution
into effect. A dinner, however, given to
Louis XVIII.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> brought matters, at last, to a conclusion;
and, satisfied of a systematic intention to degrade
her before the public, she then, at last, attained the
reluctant assent of some of the members of the Royal
Family, to her determination of finally closing her connection
with the Prince, to whom, in furtherance of this
decision, she never, afterwards, opened the doors of her
house. Upon all former occasions, to avoid etiquette
in circumstances of such delicacy as regarded her own
situation with reference to the Prince, it had been
customary to sit at table, without regard to rank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Upon the present occasion, this plan was to be altered,
and Mrs. Fitzherbert was informed, through her friends
at Court, that, at the Royal table, the individuals
invited were to sit according to their rank.</p>

<p>'When assured of this novel arrangement, she asked
the Prince, who had invited her with the rest of his
company, where she was to sit. He said, "You know,
Madam, you have no place." "None, Sir," she replied,
"but such as you choose to give me." Upon this, she
informed the Royal Family that she would not go.
The Duke of York, and others, endeavoured to alter
the preconcerted arrangement, but the Prince was
inflexible; and, aware of the peculiar circumstances of
her case, and the distressing nature of her general situation,
they no longer hesitated to agree with her, that
no advantage was to be obtained by further postponement
of her own anxious desire to close her connection
with the Prince, and to retire once more into private
life. She told me, she often looked back with wonder
that she had not sunk under the trials of those two
years.</p>

<p>'Having come to this resolution, she was obliged, on
the very evening, or on that which followed the Royal
dinner, to attend an assembly at Devonshire House,
which was the last evening she saw the Prince previously
to their final separation. The Duchess of Devonshire,
taking her by the arm, said to her, "You must come
and see the Duke in his own room, as he is suffering
from a fit of the gout, but he will be glad to see an old
friend." In passing through the rooms, she saw the
Prince and Lady Hertford in a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> conversation,
and nearly fainted under all the impressions which then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
rushed upon her mind; but, taking a glass of water, she
recovered, and passed on.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>'Thus terminated this fatal, ill-starred connection, so
unfortunate, probably, for both the parties concerned.
Satisfied as I was with the very full explanation of all
the circumstances, and of the propriety, and almost
necessity of the course which Mrs. Fitzherbert was compelled
to pursue, I yet felt, that her intimate relations
with the Prince might have imposed upon her some
duties during his last illness, the non-fulfilment of
which would have left my mind not fully satisfied. I,
therefore, again availed myself of the confidence which
had been so repeatedly urged upon me, to inquire of
her, whether any communication had taken place
previous to his demise. She told me "Yes," and
that she would show me the copy of a letter which
she had written to the King, a very short time before
his death, which, she said, had been safely delivered
by a friendly hand; the person assuring her, that the
King had seized it with eagerness, and placed it
immediately under his pillow; but, that she had not
received any answer. She was, however, informed that,
on the few last days of his life, he was very anxious to
be removed to Windsor Cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>'"Nothing," she said, "had so cut her up," to use
her own expression, as not having received one word in
reply to that last letter. It is true, she observed, that
she had been informed by the Duke of Wellington,
that he, more than once, expressed his anxiety that a
particular picture should be hung round his neck, and
deposited with him in the grave; and it seemed to be
the opinion of his Grace, that this portrait was one
which had been taken of her in early life, and was set
round with brilliants. It appeared the more likely, as
this portrait was afterwards missing when the others
were returned to her. The copy of the letter, which,
in answer to my question, she went into her bedroom
to fetch, she put into my hands to read. It was an
expression of her fears that the King was very ill, and
an affecting tender of any services she could render him,
in a strain which I could not read without sympathising
deeply in her distress.</p>

<p>'Soon after his death, she left town for Brighton.
There, she, a second time, received the kindest messages
from William the Fourth; but, upon his inquiry, why
she did not come to see him, she stated the peculiar
difficulties of her situation, and a wish, if it was not
asking too much from his condescension, that he would
graciously honour her with a personal communication
at her own house, previously to her visit to the
Pavilion.</p>

<p>'The King complied with her request, without delay,
and she told him that she could not, in her present
circumstances, avail herself of the honour of waiting
upon his Majesty, without asking his permission to
place her papers before him, and requesting his advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
upon them. Upon her placing in his hands the Documents
which have been preserved, in justification of
her character, and, especially, the certificate of her
marriage, and another, and most interesting paper, this
amiable Sovereign was moved to tears by their perusal,
and expressed his surprise at so much forbearance with
such Documents in her possession, and under pressure
of such long and severe trials. He asked her what
amends he could make her, and offered to make her a
Duchess. She replied, that she did not wish for any
rank; that she had borne through life the name of
Mrs. Fitzherbert; that she had never disgraced it, and
did not wish to change it; that, therefore, she hoped
his Majesty would accept her unfeigned gratitude for
his gracious proposal, but that he would permit her to
retain her present name.</p>

<p>'"Well, then," said he, "I shall insist upon your
wearing my livery," and ended by authorising her to
put on weeds for his Royal brother. He added, "I
must, however, soon see you at the Pavilion"; and, I
believe, he proposed the following Sunday, a day on
which his family were more retired, for seeing her at
dinner, and spending the evening at the Pavilion. "I
shall introduce you myself to my family," said he, "but
you must send me word of your arrival."</p>

<p>'At the appointed hour, upon her reaching the
Pavilion, the condescending monarch came himself and
handed her out of her carriage, and introduced her to
his family, one after the other, as one of themselves.
He, ever after, treated her in the same gracious manner,
and, on one occasion, upon her return from Paris, made
her a present of some jewels, which he said he had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
some time, but would not send them to her abroad, as
he wished to give them to her himself, on her return to
England. He afterwards entered into conversation on
matters relating to her dearest interests, and to sanction
the custody of such papers as were thought most available
in support of her honour and fair reputation with
posterity.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Fitzherbert told me that, the first day, when,
in compliance with the commands of the King, she
went to the Pavilion, and was presented by him to the
Queen and Royal Family, she was, herself, much surprised
at the great composure with which she was able
to sustain a trial of fortitude which appeared so alarming
at a distance; but she believed the excitement had
sustained her. It was not so the next dinner at which
she was present in the same family circle; and the
many reflections which then oppressed her mind, very
nearly overpowered her. Afterwards, she frequently
attended the King's small Sunday parties at Brighton,
and then, as upon all other occasions, she was received
with uniform kindness and consideration.</p>

<p>'Many letters of hers, even when writing from abroad
to fight off her marriage, had been preserved by the
King. Some were in the possession of Sir William
Knighton,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who had obtained possession of the King's
correspondence, either as being his executor, or from
having Colonel MacMahon's letters in his custody.
She had, also, various letters of her own, from the
Prince. It was, therefore, agreed, by the friends of
both parties, that, with a few exceptions, the whole
correspondence should be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>'In this arrangement, William the Fourth kindly
concurred, and it was carried into effect; only such
papers being preserved as Mrs. Fitzherbert thought fit
to select to bear witness to her character.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'Upon one memorable exception, only, she was called
upon by the Prince; and, indeed, expressly sent for to
Brighton, to give her opinion on a step of great political
importance which he was about to take, but her influence,
then, had been, some time, on the wane. He
told her that he had sent for her to ask her opinion,
and that he demanded it of her, with regard to the
party to which he was about, as Regent, to confide the
administration of the country. At his commands, she
urged in the most forcible manner that she was able,
his adherence to his former political friends. Knowing
all his engagements to that party, she used every argument
and every entreaty to induce him not to sever
himself from them. "Only retain them, Sir, six weeks
in power. If you please, you may find some pretext to
dismiss them at the end of that time; but do not break
with them without some pretext or other." Such was
her request to him. He answered, "It was impossible,
as he had promised"; but, at the same time, she
observed that he seemed much overpowered by the
effort it cost him. Finding that resistance to a determination
so fixed was unavailing, she asked to be
allowed to return to Brighton, which she did; but,
previously to leaving him, she said that, as he had
done her the honour of imposing upon her his commands
of freely declaring her sentiments upon this
occasion, she hoped he would permit her, before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
left him, to offer one suggestion, which she trusted he
would not take amiss.</p>

<p>'She then urged upon him, as strongly as she was
able, the disadvantages which must accrue to his future
happiness from treating his daughter, the Princess
Charlotte, with so little kindness. "You, now, Sir,"
she said, "may mould her at your pleasure, but, soon,
it will not be so; and she may become, from mismanagement,
a thorn in your side, for life." "That is
your opinion, Madam," was his only reply.</p>

<p>'I must, here, also add that, not only with the Royal
Family, but, also, with the Princess Caroline, Mrs. Fitzherbert
was always on the best terms. As to the
Princess Charlotte, Mrs. Fitzherbert said, the Prince
was much attached to her for some years; indeed, he
was generally fond of children and young people, and
it was only when the Princess Charlotte became the
subject of constant altercation betwixt him and those
who took part with Queen Caroline, that he, at last,
began to see her with more coolness. Upon one occasion,
Mrs. Fitzherbert told me, she was much affected
by the Princess Charlotte throwing her arms round her
neck, and beseeching her to speak to her father, that
he would receive her with greater marks of his affection;
and she told me that she could not help weeping with
this interesting child.'</p>

<p>She spent the latter part of her life almost entirely
at Brighton, beloved by the townsfolk for her goodness
and charity, and whilst she lived her servants invariably
wore the Royal livery. She died in 1837, and was buried
in the Old Catholic Church<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> at Brighton, where a hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>some
monument was erected to her memory by the Hon.
Mrs. Lionel Dawson Damer, whom we have known as
Miss Mary Seymour. It bears the following inscription:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In a vault near this spot, are deposited the remains of
Maria Fitzherbert. She was born on the 26th July,
1756, and expired at Brighton, on the 29th March, 1837.
One, to whom she was more than a parent, has placed
this monument to her revered and beloved memory, as a
humble tribute of her gratitude and affection.'</p></blockquote>

<p>On her wedding-finger are three rings, in allusion to
her three marriages.</p>

<p>The Prince was more or less at Brighton in 1808,
1809, and 1810, when came the death of the Princess
Amelia, and the mental aberration of the poor old King.
On February 11, 1811, the Prince of Wales was sworn in
as Regent, and for the next two or three years Brighton
saw little of him; only the Pavilion was always growing
bigger. Marlborough House was purchased, in 1812,
for £9,000, and in 1813 a series of improvements and
additions were made, which lasted till 1818. In 1814
the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Russia came
to England on a visit&mdash;the former, in passing through
Brighton, spending ten minutes at the Pavilion for
refreshment, and the latter going all over it, besides
walking on the Steine.</p>

<p>Queen Charlotte paid a visit to the Prince Regent at
the Pavilion on October 24, 1814, accompanied by the
Princesses Elizabeth and Mary, and they stopped until
the 29th, visiting, during their stay, various parts of
the town, and expressing themselves much satisfied
with the situation and appearance of the place, and the
general respectability and conduct of the inhabitants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Before her Majesty left the town, she ordered £50 to
be distributed among the poor, and became the patroness
of the Dollar Society for their relief, towards which both
she and the Princesses liberally subscribed.</p>

<p>They paid another visit to Brighton the next year, as
the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for 1815 records:</p>

<p>'<i>Brighton. Dec. 14.</i>&mdash;Her Majesty and the two
Princesses arrived on a visit to the Prince Regent, at the
Pavilion. The principal inhabitants, having received
permission, went to Patcham, dressed in buff and
mounted, to escort her Majesty; a dutiful address was
presented on the occasion, to which her Majesty returned
a gracious verbal answer. Her Majesty, on entering
Brighton, seemed to be highly pleased with the attention
paid her, and repeatedly bowed to the gentlemen
who escorted her. The Prince Regent remained from
three o'clock until the arrival of his august mother,
outside the gate of the Pavilion, with the Duke of
Clarence and several of the nobility, to receive the Queen
and Princesses.&mdash;On the 16th, her Majesty, accompanied
by the Duke of Clarence, with the two Princesses, in a
carriage, passed through the principal streets of the
town, notwithstanding the dampness of the atmosphere,
and was every where received with the most marked
respect and homage.'</p>

<p>It was of this visit that the following satire<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> (believed
to have been written by C. F. Lawler) was penned. I
can only give a portion, as it is too long; but I give it,
as it exhibits the popular belief of the doings at the
Pavilion:</p>

visitors&mdash;The Regent's statues&mdash;'High life below stairs,'

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t1.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE Regent was always being satirized by
the publication of some of his own
puerilities, or those of his suite, who, of
course, took their tone from him. The
<cite>Brighton Herald</cite> is responsible for the
following anecdote:</p>

<p>'A gallant Admiral (Nagle) residing at the Pavilion,
was, a few days since, presented by a certain Great
Personage, with a beautiful milk white mare, which, it
was stated, had just arrived from Hanover. Nothing
was talked of but this fine creature; and every one
seemed anxious to have her merits put to the test. The
Admiral mounted, tried her in all her paces, and, though
he could but approve, yet he pronounced her to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
greatly inferior to a favourite black mare of his own.
The present, however, coming from so high a quarter,
was, of course, received with every expression of duty
and thankfulness. The long switching tail of the
animal not exactly suiting the Admiral's taste, he
sent her to a farrier to have it cropped&mdash;when, lo!
he speedily received intelligence that it was a <em>false</em>
tail, and that, beneath it appeared a short black one.
This curious fact led to a minute inspection, when it
was discovered that this <em>beautiful white Hanoverian
horse</em> was no other than the good humoured Admiral's
own <em>black mare</em>, which had been painted in a manner
to elude his detection.'</p>

<p>This anecdote is probably true, as Captain Gronow
('Reminiscences,' second series, p. 212) tells a similar
story, only he changes the venue from Brighton to
Carlton House:</p>

<p>'Admiral Nagle was a great favourite of George
the Fourth, and passed much of his time with his
Majesty. He was a bold, weather beaten tar, but,
nevertheless, a perfect gentleman, with exceedingly
pleasing manners, and possessed of much good nature
and agreeability.</p>

<p>'The late Duke of Cambridge, on one occasion, sent
his brother a cream coloured horse from the Royal stud
at Hanover, and the King gave the animal to Colonel
Peters, the riding master. Admiral Nagle ventured to
express a hope that, if his Majesty received a similar
present from Hanover, he would graciously make him a
present of it; upon which the King replied, "Certainly,
Nagle, you shall have one."</p>

<p>'The Admiral was, shortly afterwards, sent to Ports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>mouth,
to superintend the building of the Royal Yacht,
during which time Strohling, the fashionable painter
of the day, was summoned, and ordered to paint the
Admiral's favourite hack, to make it appear like one
of the Hanoverian breed. The horse was, accordingly,
placed in the riding school, and, in an incredibly short
period, the metamorphosis was successfully completed.
In due time the Admiral returned from Portsmouth,
and, as usual, went to the Royal Stables, and was
charmed to see that his Majesty had fulfilled his promise.
He lost no time in going to Carlton House to return
thanks, when the King said, "Well, Nagle, how do you
like the horse I sent you?" "Very much," was the reply,
"but I should like to try his paces before I can give
your Majesty a decided opinion about him." "Well,
then, let him be saddled, though it does rain, and gallop
him round the park and return here, and let me know
what you think of him." It rained cats and dogs; the
paint was gradually washed off the horse, to the Admiral's
great astonishment, and he returned to Carlton House,
where the King and his friends had watched his departure
and arrival with the greatest delight. The Admiral was
welcomed with roars of laughter, which he took with
very great good humour; and, about a month afterwards,
the King presented him with a real Hanoverian
horse of great value.'</p>

<p>These Christmas festivities probably produced a fit
of gout, which brought the Queen and Princesses,
together with the Princess Charlotte, to the Pavilion,
on a visit, from January 6, 1816, to January 20&mdash;a visit
which covered the birthdays of the Princess Charlotte
and Her Majesty, both of which were nobly celebrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>This seems to have been a quiet time at the Pavilion,
if we may credit a letter from the Dowager Countess of
Ilchester to Lady Harriet Frampton, dated from Cranborne
Lodge, February 2, 1816:<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>'... I must tell you that the fortnight at Brighton
has had a very happy effect on Princess Charlotte's
health and spirits.... You have no idea how her
manners are daily softened by witnessing the address of
the Queen and Princesses, with whom she went regularly
round the circle, paying individual attention to the
company, and she looked, really, very handsome, being
always elegantly dressed, and every one seemed delighted
to have her under her father's roof.</p>

<p>'It certainly was a great satisfaction to the Prince to
find it gave so much pleasure to the Princess, for he
had been led to suspect she did not like to come&mdash;a
complete mistake, of which he is now convinced....
The Chinese room is gay beyond description, and I am
sure you would admire it, as well as the rest of the
Pavilion, though the extreme warmth does not suit
every one.</p>

<p>'In the morning, all the guests were free from Court
restraint, and met only at six o'clock, punctually, for
dinner, to the number of between thirty and forty
daily; in the evening, about as many more were
invited. A delightful band played till half past
eleven, when the Royal family retired, and the rest
of the company dispersed, after partaking of sandwiches:
the evenings were not in the least formal. As
soon as the Queen sat down to cards, every one moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
about as they pleased, and made their own backgammon,
chess, or card party, but lounging up and
down the gallery was most favoured. All the rooms
open into the beautiful gallery, which is terminated at
both extremities by the lightest and prettiest Chinese
staircases you can imagine, and illuminated by the
gayest lanterns. There are mandarins and pagodas in
abundance, and plenty of Japanese and Chinese sofas.
In the centre of the gallery is a skylight. Each staircase
opens into a large room, one of these communicating
with the Queen's suite of rooms, and the other with
that of the Princess and mine. The effect of the
central room is very good. There was a bright fire,
and it is supplied with books and newspapers, and from
one set of rooms to the other is a private communication.'</p>

<p>Prince Leopold also stopped at the Pavilion for some
time previous to his marriage with the Princess Charlotte,
which took place May 2, 1816.</p>

<p>In spite of the enormous taxation, the dearness of
bread, etc., the extravagances of Florizel knew no
bounds. What cared he, so long as every whim and
wish of his was gratified, who found the money for it?
In three years he had spent £160,000 on furniture for
Carlton House; the previous year china cost £12,000,
ormolu nearly £3,000, and during three years he owed
his silversmith £130,000. He had £100,000 allotted
him for an outfit when he came to the Regency; that
had to go to pay some of his debts, and Lord Castlereagh
was obliged to admit that the Prince's debts
amounted to £339,000!</p>

<p>Yet, forsooth, the great baby must have another toy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
at the expense of the nation&mdash;a yacht, all over gilding.
William Hone published a single-sheet broadside
(August 26, 1816) with a picture and description of
this rococo vessel. Here is his <span class="smcap">'Description of the
Regent's New Gilt Yacht</span>:</p>

<p>'This superb yacht, the <em>Royal Sovereign</em>, was
launched from Deptford Yard on Thursday, the 8th
of August, 1816, having been newly copper bottomed,
and entirely new <em>gilt</em>, and fitted up throughout.&mdash;She
is between three and four hundred tons burthen, has
three masts, is ship rigged, and is the most splendid
vessel, beyond all comparison, ever launched in England.&mdash;The
bust of his Majesty forms the head, <em>richly gilt</em>;
surmounted by a canopy, painted crimson, with fringe
and tassels in <em>gold</em>.&mdash;The head rails have carved figures
of Peace and <em>Plenty</em>(!) which <em>support</em> the bust, with a
frieze of devices to the bows, carved and <em>gilt</em>.&mdash;Above
the channels is a frieze&mdash;boys supporting the Cardinal
Virtues, united by festoons of laurel, <em>all gilt</em>. The
quarter badge, representing the Star and Garter, supported
by the Lion and Unicorn, is a complete blaze of
<em>gilding</em>. The stern is most superbly <em>gilt</em>&mdash;in the centre
of the taffrel is a King's Coat of Arms, supported by
Prudence and Fame, carved and <em>gilt</em>. Fortitude and
Truth are carved at the sides of the stern, richly <em>gilt</em>.
The lower counter is an emblematical painting, <em>gilt</em>.
On the right of the rudder is Neptune, drawn by four
Sea Horses, a painting, <em>gilt</em>. On the left of the rudder
is Britannia, pointing to the Arts, a painting, <em>gilt</em>.
Above the rudder is a Star, presumed to be the Star of
Brunswick, as if presiding,&mdash;<em>gilt</em>. The upper counter is
Cupids with laurel, painted and <em>gilt</em>. Over the poop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
are three magnificent lanterns, in blue and <em>gold</em>, with
stars on the top, <em>gilt</em>. The quarter deck is separated
from the main deck by a rich carved breast rail, <em>gilt</em>.
The sides of the quarter deck are devices painted in
compartments, <em>gilt</em>.</p>

<p>'The gallery is fitted up for a kitchen, with steam
boilers and other cooking apparatus. Adjoining it is
the Lord's room, in white, with panel mouldings <em>gilt</em>&mdash;the
roof supported by fluted pilasters, with Ionic caps,
all <em>gilt</em>. The passages are white and <em>gold</em>. The roof
of the King's room is panelled mahogany and <em>gold</em>; the
sides crimson damask panels, the framings <em>gold</em>; twenty
carved emblematical figures, the four Elements, etc., are
on pedestals with Ionic caps of mahogany and <em>gold</em>.
Round the rudder case are three beautiful plates of
looking glass, entirely concealing the wood, in frames
to correspond, <em>gilt</em>. The Queen's room is fitted up, in
every respect, with the same grandeur as to materials
and <em>gilding</em>. The descent to the State rooms is by
a superb mahogany winding staircase, the balustrades
richly carved and <em>gilt</em>; the sides panelled with
mahogany and <em>gold</em>. The ceilings and doors to the
State rooms are of the finest mahogany, in panels, with
carved borders, richly <em>gilt</em>. The doors in the centre
cabin are covered with mirrors. The chairs and sofas
are of crimson damask, in mahogany frames, <em>gilt</em>. The
windows are of plate glass, and draw up and down, like
those of a coach, the sides painted a deep vermilion,
the edges <em>gilt</em>. To suspend the tables, that they may
swing with the vessel, chains descend from the ceilings,
as if for lamps, elegantly <em>gilt</em>. The side windows, one
on each side the stern, are two immense concaves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
plate glass, like mirrors; from each of which, on
the outside the vessel, rays diverge, to form a splendid
star, superbly <em>gilt</em>. The predominant feature of the
decorations is <em>costly gilding</em>; even the blocks carrying
the ladders and the rigging, are fully <em>gilt</em>. The vessel
has been put in its present state, for the Prince
Regent, at an estimated expence of <span class="smcap">Sixty Thousand
Pounds</span>; the <em>gilding</em>, alone, is supposed to have
cost nearly <em>Thirteen Thousand, Five Hundred Pounds</em>!
She now lies off the Dockyard at Deptford, with
the workmen on board; and, when completed, will,
with the Divine permission, sail to Brighton, for his
Royal Highness's use. Her apparatus for roasting,
baking, boiling, frying, stewing, broiling, etc., is complete.
And it is remarkable that the Cardinal
Virtues are amongst the most prominent decorations
<em>outside</em>.'</p>

<p>This new plaything was at Brighton in the summer
of 1817, and we read in a newspaper cutting that:</p>

<p>'On the 10th September, for the Regent's especial
delectation, a sham fight took place at sea, immediately
off the town, the vessels taking part in it being the
<em>Inconstant</em> and <em>Tigris</em> frigates, the <em>Grecian</em> armed
schooner, and the <em>Rosario</em> brig. The Channel was
thickly dotted with packets and pleasure boats, and
every species of floating craft, each and all crowded
with spectators, anxious to witness the coming conflict;
the cliffs from one end of the town to the other were
also thronged. The Prince Regent embarked at
10 a.m., and, as soon as the Royal barge was afloat,
simultaneous salutes were fired from the ships of war,
and were repeated as soon as his Royal Highness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
on board his yacht was announced, by the Royal
standard being hoisted at the main.</p>

<p>'The order of battle was, that the <em>Inconstant</em> and
the <em>Grecian</em> were to defend the yacht against the
designs of the supposed enemy, in the <em>Tigris</em> and the
<em>Rosario</em>. The vessels, respectively, were most skilfully
manœuvred, and broadside after broadside sent their
rattling reports to land. At length, the escape of the
yacht was effected; but the enemy still stood to their
guns. In fact, the conflict between the frigates became
still more severe, during which, within pistol shot of
each other, many discharges of musketry marked the
apparently determined progress of the action. The
spectacle was grand, and wrought the feelings of the
spectators to the highest pitch. The battle over,
which ended in the retreat of the enemy, the <em>Royal
George</em> stood in, and the whole returned to the roadstead
about 2 p.m. In the evening a boat was sent
ashore, to announce the Regent's intention of remaining
on board all night.'</p>

<p>Apropos of this naval engagement, a humorous print
was published in October, 1817, entitled, 'Fun at Sea&mdash;the
sham fight off Brighton, and the capture of the
Knight of the Larder, Privateer, or, the Alderman in
Chains.' Alderman Sir William Curtis is brought on
board the Regent's yacht a prisoner, bound in chains of
sausages,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> accompanied by sailors bearing turtles, fowls,
soup, etc., whilst an officer exhibits a scroll of Ammunition
Stores taken in the Larder Sloop. Ammunition&mdash;500
Forced meat <em>balls</em>, 5 Barrels Curry <em>Powder</em>, 2 casks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
whole Pepper, 200 Bottles Sauce piquant.&mdash;Stores&mdash;1
whole Calf, 25 Sheep, 12 dozen Capons, 50 Haunches
of Venison,&mdash;Westphalia Hams, 2 cwt. of Sausages,
100 Rounds of Beef, 100 Sir Loins, 150 doz. of
Pigeons, 50 Sucking pigs.' Sir William Curtis is
kneeling, and, offering the Regent a carving knife
and ladle, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'Great conqueror, see your captive kneel;</div>
<div class="verse">Your clemency now let him feel!</div>
<div class="verse">Here's all my arms, upon my life,</div>
<div class="verse">My Ladle and my Carving Knife.</div>
<div class="verse">My Vessel Fame "the Larder" calls,</div>
<div class="verse">My Ammunition Forced meat balls,</div>
<div class="verse">My Powder, Curry, whole Pepper, Shot,</div>
<div class="verse">All, by my Capture, going to Pot:</div>
<div class="verse">Then, let me hope you'll grant this Boon,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Release me speedily, and soon</em>!</div>
<div class="verse">I'm bit of a poet, you see, this is rare fun.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Regent, looking at him, says, 'What! we have
caught you, have we? and in arms against your
Sovereign! We'll just drench you with grog, and keelhaul
you&mdash;and then release you, my old buck. You
love fun!'</p>

<p>Sir William was fond of the sea, and the Whig and
Radical wits were never tired of laughing at the sumptuous
fittings of his yacht, in which the Regent often
accompanied him in his cruises. He was very badly
educated, and is said to have been the author of the
famous 'Three R's: Reading, Riting and Rithmetic.'</p>

<p>According to the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for 1817,
the Regent had quite a cruise in his new toy:</p>

<p>'<i>Monday, Sept. 15.</i>&mdash;The Prince Regent arrived last
night at Carlton House from Brighton, having, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the week, been four days, and three nights at sea! The
Prince commenced his aquatic excursions on Monday,
when His R.H. remained at sea ten hours; and, on
Wednesday, accompanied by Admirals Sir George Campbell,
and Sir Edmund Nagle, Lord William Gordon,
Sir William Keppel, the Hon. Capt. Paget, and Capt.
Horace Seymour, His R.H. embarked in the <em>Royal
George</em> yacht on a second voyage, under salutes from
the <em>Tigris</em>, <em>Inconstant</em>, <em>Rosario</em>, <em>Grecian</em>, <em>Viper</em> and
<em>Hound</em>: and, at half past one, the ships of war went
through all the manœuvres of an engagement. At
night, the vessels proceeded to sea; and, the next day,
they stood over to the coast of France, and were off
Dieppe, close in with the land, early on Friday morning;
where, communication being had, the yacht and squadron
cruised across the Channel again, and reached Brighton
at one o'clock on Saturday, when the Prince landed,
regretting that his presence being required in town, he
was obliged to disembark.</p>

<p>'His Royal Highness was gratified beyond description,
and enjoyed the highest state of health and spirits
during the excursion. On disembarking, the Prince
presented the Hon. Capt. Paget with a most elegant
snuff box, in testimony of his high gratification and
esteem; and so ardent and perfect was the pleasure
that His R.H. felt, that, among other gracious intimations
of his attachment to the Naval service, he said
that, if he should land at any other place besides
Brighton, it was his intention to wear the full dress
uniform of an Admiral, and which he should continue
to wear, at his <em>levées</em>, alternately with the dress of the
army.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>On January 15, 1817, the Grand-Duke Nicholas
(afterwards Emperor) of Russia visited the Prince at
the Pavilion, and stayed four days.</p>

<p>Directly after the funeral of the Princess Charlotte,
who died on November 5, the Prince went to Brighton,
and stayed there eleven weeks.</p>

<p>In September, 1818, the Grand-Duke Michael of
Russia paid a visit to the Pavilion, which in that month
was lit by gas. '<cite>The Brighton Ambulator</cite>,' by C. Wright
(<em>London and Brighton</em>, 1818) gives a very good description
of the Pavilion, and mentions that 'a statue of
the Prince of Wales, by Rossi, 7 feet high, on a pedestal
11 feet high, was, in the year 1802, placed in front of
the Royal Crescent. The Prince is represented as
dressed in his regimental uniform, with his arm extended
towards the sea. This statue cost upwards
of £300. The likeness is not considered very striking,
and, since it has been injured by the loss of one
of the arms, it is not even deemed a pleasing ornament.'</p>

<p>In 1821 it was proposed to erect, on some conspicuous
spot in the town, a large bronze statue of George IV.,
and £3,000 was very quickly subscribed for it. For
this sum Chantrey agreed to produce it, and pay for
the casting; but he made a bad bargain, as it cost
nearly double the sum. It was unveiled on October 11,
1828.</p>

<p>The alterations to the Pavilion were not altogether
finished; yet the Prince made shift somehow, as he was
most certainly there in March, 1819, for we read in the
<cite>Times</cite> of March 15:</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Royal Condescension.</span>&mdash;We are assured that, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
nights ago, the <span class="smcap">Prince Regent</span>, in a merry mood, determined
to sup in the kitchen of the Pavilion. A scarlet
cloth was thrown over the pavement, a splendid repast
was provided, and the good humoured <span class="smcap">Prince</span> sat down,
with a select party of his friends, and spent a joyous
hour. The whole of the servants, particularly the
female part, were, of course, delighted with this mark
of condescension (<cite>Brighton Herald</cite>).'</p>

<p>Then the pictorial satirists swooped down upon him,
and curious were their different conceptions of the event.
I give the one I consider best, as it is the least offensive,
and the Regent is so 'royally drunk.' It is by J. R.
Cruikshank, and was published on March 25. It is
called '<span class="smcap">High life below Stairs!</span> a new Farce, as lately
perform'd at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, for the
edification and amusement of the Cooks, Scullions,
Dishwashers, Lick trenchers, Shoe blacks, Cinder sifters,
Candle snuffers, etc., etc., of that Theatre, but which
was unfortunately Damn'd the first night by Common
Sense!'</p>

<img src="images/i_256fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">HIGH LIFE BELOW STAIRS.</div>
</div>

<p>Others are (all in the same month), '<span class="smcap">Royal Kitchen
Stuff!</span> or a Great Man <em>come down</em> to visit his most
Obed<sup>t</sup> humble Servants!!! (vide the amusements of
Brighton).' The Prince has a fat cook round the neck,
kissing her, and saying, 'Don't be alarmed, my dear!
I only want to see how my private affairs get on below
here, so show me your Kitchen Stuff.' The cook, who
beats him with a ladle, says, 'La, Sir! what will the
people say when they hear of your meddling so often
with things beneath you? Depend upon it, you'll be
call'd over the Coals, and finely roasted for this.' A
maid-servant has hold of his coat-tails, and calls out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
'Baste him well! Give him Goose without Gravy!'
On the floor lie two papers&mdash;one, 'Theatre Royal,
Brighton, By Command of the Prince Regent, High
life below Stairs, with Animal Magnetism'; the other is,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">That most female hearts I subdue,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Another is, 'He stoops to Conquer, or the Royal
George <em>Sunk</em>. This is not the Royal George that was
sunk at Spithead, this was sunk at Brighton.' A third
is entitled 'Beauties of Grease, or Luxuries of the
Kremlin'; and a fourth is, 'Royal George in the Kitchen,
or High life below Stairs.' The Prince, with a bumper
in his hand, nurses a cook on his knee, to whom he
remarks:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It would seem, also, that he gave a servants' ball at
Christmas, 1820, at the Pavilion, for there is a satirical
print, published January 24, 1821, called '<span class="smcap">Low life

<p>In the beginning of January, 1820, the inhabitants
of Brighton were allowed, for a fortnight, to visit the
Pavilion and view its wonders, as far as it was then
completed; on the 29th of the same month the old
King died, and Florizel, then in his fifty-ninth year,
succeeded him, as George IV. He came to the Pavilion
at the end of February, and stayed at Brighton nearly
the whole of March.</p>

<p>A satirical print represents him as being at the
Pavilion in November of this year. It is called
'<span class="smcap">Moments of Pain.</span>' The scene is an apartment in
the Pavilion, and the surroundings are all Chinese.
The King is dressed in full Chinese costume, the great
'Fum' bird being embroidered on his bosom; he is
very ill, and a physician is feeling his pulse. On the
floor lies a huge roll of a 'List of Addresses presented
to Caroline, Queen of England,' and an attendant is
trying to prevent the entrance of a messenger, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
brings the news of 'The Bill turned out.' This was
the Bill of pains and penalties brought into Parliament
against her by Lord Liverpool on July 5, 1820; the
trial began on August 19, and the Bill was abandoned
on November 18.</p>

<p>The King spent his Christmas at Brighton, and as
he was a full-fledged monarch, his ideas expanded as
to his country residence, and the assembly-room of the
Castle Tavern was absorbed into the building, and converted
into a chapel. Then also was arranged the
alterations which have made the Pavilion the extraordinary
conglomeration of buildings it now is. The
chapel was consecrated on January 1, 1822.</p>

<p>He left Brighton in April, went to Scotland in
August, and returned to Brighton in October. In
January, 1823, he had a terrible attack of gout, and
he did not leave the Pavilion till April. Naturally, now
that he was King, he had to spend much of his time
in London; but he spent the Christmas of 1824 at
Brighton, and stayed there till the following February.
He never made but one more visit to Brighton&mdash;from
January 23, 1827, to March 7&mdash;and Florizel's stupendous
Folly knew him no more.</p>

of his 'folly' than the building
itself in a magnificent folio volume of
etchings, plain and coloured, a task

who employed the artistic assistance of Wilks,
Moore, and the elder Pugin, especially the latter, and
it took five years (1820 to 1825) to complete.</p>

<p>I have reserved the description of this building until

of 1836 made a careful survey of the Pavilion, which
had but very slightly been altered since the death of
George IV.</p>


<p class="center">'THE ROYAL PALACE AT BRIGHTON,</p>

<p class="center">'<small>FORMERLY THE PAVILION</small>.</p>

<p>'This Edifice, which, in respect to architectural form,
has no parallel in Europe, nor perhaps on the globe, is
indebted for its origin to his late Majesty <span class="smcap">George the
Fourth</span>, who, when Prince of Wales, first went to
Brighton in the autumn of the year 1782 (?), on a
visit to his uncle the late Duke of Cumberland, then
residing at his house, near the south end of the Steyne,
and not far from the cliff. The consequences of that
visit have been extraordinary.</p>

<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>'The greatly increased and still augmenting prosperity
of this town, however, is almost wholly due to
the patronage which it received from the late Prince of
Wales, who, whilst the guest of his uncle, as above
noticed, became so pleased with the situation and air,
and the bold, open, and diversified character of the
downs and neighbouring country, that he, again, visited
Brighton in the following summer, and in the next
year (1784) the Prince commenced the erection of the
<em>Marine Pavilion</em>, now the Royal Palace, for the purpose
of forming a distinct and appropriate habitation for
himself and suite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>'The <i lang="fr">éclat</i> attending the residence of such an illustrious
person as the Heir apparent to the Crown,
attracted a great resort of company to Brighton, and
numerous respectable mansions and rows of houses were
quickly built for the accommodation and entertainment
of those continually flocking thither. The impulse
thus given cannot be said to have yet ceased; and,
though the town has been so greatly extended, that
it already covers full six times as much ground as when
it first engaged the notice of the Prince of Wales,
scarcely a year passes without a considerable augmentation,
both in the number of its inhabitants, and of its
buildings. A still further increase is also contemplated,
to which the projected <em>Railway</em> from the metropolis
(that occasioned so much controversial enquiry during
the sitting of Parliament in 1837) is expected essentially
to contribute, by the superior accommodation it will
afford for speedy intercourse. Having, thus, briefly
adverted to the vast change in the state of Brighton,
which has resulted from princely patronage and abode,
we shall proceed to the immediate object of this work,
<em>viz.</em>, the description of the Palace itself.</p>

<p>'The <em>Marine Pavilion</em>, as it was originally called,
was commenced in 1784, under the superintendence of
the late Henry Holland Esq<sup>re</sup>, architect, whose professional
talents were, afterwards, so eminently displayed
by the magnificent Drury Lane Theatre, which was
destroyed by fire in February, 1809. In its first state,
the Pavilion, as completed by Mr. Holland in 1787,
consisted of a circular edifice, attached by semicircular
projections to two adjoining buildings, forming wings.
The central part (which was crowned by a dome, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
cupola, and fronted by an Ionic colonnade and entablature,
supporting statues), and the north wing, were new
erections, but the south wing was merely altered from
the villa which had been first hired for the occasional
residence of the Prince of Wales, and was, subsequently,
purchased by his Royal Highness. In succeeding years,
and, particularly, in 1801 and 1802, additional buildings
were raised by the same architect, or, rather, by
his pupil, Mr. F. P. Robinson, F.S.A., who was stationed
at the Pavilion, and, during Mr. Holland's absence on
some mining affairs in Cornwall, had the special direction
of the works in progress.</p>

<p>'Whilst the improvements were going on, in the year
1802, several pieces of very beautiful Chinese paper
were presented to the Prince, who, for a time, was
undecided in what way to make use of them. As the
Eating room and the Library, which were between the
Saloon and the new Northern wing, were no longer
required for their original purposes, Mr. Robinson, on
being consulted, advised the Prince to have the partition
removed, and the interior formed into a Chinese gallery.
This was immediately agreed to; the walls were hung
with the paper described, and the other parts of the
Gallery were painted and decorated in a corresponding
style. About the same time, the passage room between
what was, then, called the Small Drawing Room, and
the New Conservatory, or Music room, at the south
end of the Pavilion, was constructed in a singular
manner. A space was enclosed within it, measuring
twelve feet by eight, the sides and upper part of which
were entirely formed of stained glass, of an oriental
character, and exhibiting the peculiar insects, fruits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
flowers, etc., of China. It was illuminated from without;
and through it, as through an immense Chinese lantern,
the communication was carried on; its effect is stated
to have been extremely beautiful. Such, then, were
the circumstances under which the Eastern style of
decoration was first adopted at the Pavilion; and, soon
afterwards, between the years 1803 and 1805, the same
principle was extended to its architecture; the new
Stables, which were then erected by Mr. William
Porden, being considered as designed in the Hindû
style.</p>

<p>'Although the Pavilion itself had been much enlarged,
and had, recently, undergone extensive alterations, the
Prince had still further changes in contemplation; and,
in 1805, he issued his commands to Mr. H. Repton
(who was much celebrated for his judicious practice in
landscape gardening, and had already been employed
in improving the grounds at Brighton), to deliver his
opinion "concerning what style of architecture would
be most suitable for the Pavilion." The result was
made known to the Prince early in the ensuing year;
and, in the spring of 1808, was communicated to the
public in a folio work of much interest, which includes
a series of coloured plates of proposed improvements,
both in the House and Grounds. Though Mr. Repton's
designs in respect to the Pavilion were never carried
into effect, the arguments which he employed for giving
it an Eastern character, had, doubtless, considerable
influence over its present form; a short extract from
his work will, therefore, be admissible.</p>

<p>'Mr. Repton ingenuously owns that his knowledge
of the various forms of Hindû architecture was derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
from communications first made to him by the proprietor
of Sesincot, in Gloucestershire (Sir Charles Cockerell,
who had been long resident in the interior of India);
and, afterwards, corroborated by the accurate sketches
and drawings made on the spot by his ingenious friend,
Mr. Thomas Daniell. He then says, "Immediately
after I had reconciled my mind to the adoption of this
new style at Sesincot, I received the Prince's commands
to visit Brighton, and there saw, in some degree, realised,
the new forms which I had admired in the drawings.
I found, in the Gardens of the Pavilion, a stupendous
and magnificent building, which, by its lightness, its
elegance, its boldness of construction, and the symmetry
of its proportions, does credit both to the genius of
the Artist, and the good taste of his Royal employer.
Although the outline of the Dome resembles rather a
Turkish Mosque than the buildings of Hindûstan, yet,
its general character is distinct from either Grecian or
Gothic, and must both please and surprise every one
not bigoted to the forms of either.</p>

<p>'"When, therefore, I was commanded to deliver my
opinion concerning the style of architecture best adapted
to the additions and Garden front for the Pavilion, I
could not hesitate in agreeing that neither the Grecian,
nor the Gothic style could be made to assimilate with
what had so much the character of an Eastern building.
I considered all the different styles of different countries,
from a conviction of the danger of attempting to invent
anything entirely new. The Turkish was objectionable,
as being a corruption of the Grecian; the Moorish, as
a bad model of the Gothic; the Egyptian, as too
cumbrous for the character of a Villa; the Chinese, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
light and trifling for the outside; however it may be
applied to the interior; and specimens from Ava were
still more trifling and extravagant. Thus, if any known
style were to be adopted, no alternative remained, but
to combine from the architecture of Hindûstan such
forms as might be rendered applicable to the purpose."</p>

<p>'Acting on this principle, Mr. Repton produced the
series of drawings which have been referred to; and it
is but just to add, that his designs for the Pavilion
evince a clearness of conception, and a boldness and
accuracy of outline, and combination of forms in the
Hindû style, which far surpass the anomalous conceptions
that determined the external character of the
present edifice.</p>

<p>'The Plan of Brighton, published in 1809, shews
that the Pavilion was still in a state of progressive
enlargement. Several neighbouring houses had been
previously bought, and annexed to the premises, and
the whole assumed, in a great measure, the form and
arrangement represented by the Ground Plan in Plate I.,
in which state it remained until the late John Nash,
Esq<sup>re</sup>, architect, commenced his alterations in the year
1817. Those alterations were carried on during a considerable
time, under the direct <em>surveillance</em> of the Prince
himself, whose own facility of invention, and correctness
of taste, tended greatly to increase the elegance of the
interior. Numerous additions were also made to the
buildings, until, at length, about the year 1824, the edifice
was completed in the manner in which it now appears.
Instead of the plain and humble character of a <em>Marine</em>
abode, it assumes, in its external architecture, the varied
characteristics of an Oriental style, and domes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
cones, and minarets spring from its roofs to a considerable
altitude.</p>

<p>'In the general design of this <em>unique</em> edifice, much
fancy is exhibited, and great ingenuity and professional
skill are displayed in the construction of its domes and
conical cupolas; yet there is little in the composition,
exteriorly, that would elicit praise from an admirer of
classic elegance. There is, however, ornament in profusion,
and this, in combination with the singular aspect
of the entire fabric, makes a considerable impression on
the eye, and especially so, if the spectator be unacquainted
with the details of classic architecture; this
effect would, doubtless, be stronger, if the Pavilion
stood upon elevated ground. With the exception of
the minarets, pinnacles, and minor ornaments, which
are of Bath stone, nearly the whole building is of brick,
stuccoed.</p>

<p>'The expense of completing and furnishing this
building was very great; and, independently of many
lavish sums issued for those purposes from the Civil
List, upwards of £100,000 was paid from the Privy
purse of its magnificent founder in aid of the charges
for furniture and decorations. On the accession of the
Prince Regent to the Crown, after the decease of his
father, in January, 1820, the Pavilion became a Royal
Palace; and, on his own decease, in 1830, it descended,
together with the succession, to his brother, the Duke
of Clarence, the late King William the Fourth. It,
afterwards, became a favourite residence of this sovereign
(and his now dowager, Queen Adelaide), who passed
some portion of every year there until his death in
June, 1837. During a few weeks in the past autumn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the Palace was inhabited by his successor, <span class="smcap">Victoria</span>,
her present Majesty; <span class="smcap">Whom God preserve!</span></p>


<p class="center">'<small>EXTERIOR OF THE PALACE</small>.</p>

<p>'The Ground-plot forms a long parallelogram; the
extent of the building from north to south being
480 feet, and from east to west, about 125 feet: of this
space, upwards of two thirds is occupied by the Royal
apartments and their appendages; and the remainder
by the great kitchen, chapel, servants' rooms, and
domestic offices.</p>

<p>'Since the Pavilion was first built, it has been greatly
and progressively enlarged, as above detailed, and,
together with the adjoining grounds and stabling, it
now occupies an extensive plot of ground, nearly in the
centre of the town, and immediately contiguous to the
far famed Steyne and Parade. The whole of the demesne
comprises ten acres, the principal part of which was
obtained by purchase, and the rest by grant from the
manorial owners and town's people.</p>

<p>'The principal, or eastern front of the Palace, opens
on to a lawn, which is merely separated from the Steyne
Parade by a low wall and dwarf enclosure, at the
distance, from the building, of 170 feet. On the north
side are shrubberies; and, on the west, which includes
the main entrance, are the pleasure grounds and carriage
drive. The southern extremity, comprehending the
Chapel Royal and offices, projects into Castle Square.</p>

<p>'From this Plate, it would seem that this front might
be described as consisting of seven parts; namely, a
centre, of a curvilinear form, connected by adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
divisions to two wings, and those again flanked by
square buildings, forming returns to the north and
south: yet this is not strictly the case, the southern
return never having been completed. In all other
respects the Elevation is correct.</p>

<p>'The Centre division which includes the <em>Rotunda</em>, or
<em>Saloon</em>, and has a semicircular arcade in front, is crowned
by a vast dome, presenting the appearance of an inverted
balloon, tapering upwards into a lofty pinnacle, the
point of which is more than one hundred feet from the
ground. The dome is surrounded by a horizontal band
of twenty eight conjoined ovals (crossing a similar
number of vertical ribs), most of which are pierced as
windows to the several small apartments contained in
its concavity. It is also flanked by two octagonal
minarets, and appears to rise from a basement cone,
faced with scale work. Smaller domes, of a more compressed
form, surmount the semicircular recesses which
adjoin the Saloon; these have ornamental bands and
vertical ribs, but no windows. The arcade spandrils
are filled up with curvilinear trellis work, inclosing
quatrefoils; and, over the middle part, is the Prince of
Wales's crest, and this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
'"<span class="smcap">H.R.H. George. P.W.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap"><small>A.D. MDCCCXI</small>.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>'Similar domes to those last described, surmount the
<em>Green</em> and <em>Yellow Drawing Rooms</em> (as they are now
called), which connect the Saloon with the wings, and
are each curved at the ends. The upper chambers
recede, and before each range is a balcony and pierced
parapet. The wings, which are of a square form, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
surmounted by lofty cones, rising to the height of about
ninety feet; at the angles are minarets. In front of
both wings is an open arcade, composed of seven arches,
separated from each other by octagonal columns, and
ornamented by similar trellis work to that of the Saloon
arcade. The Southern extremity terminates in a square
tower crowned by a dome, and minarets corresponding
with those already described. A sort of running
battlement, with very narrow embrasures, surmounts
the upper line of the whole building.</p>

<img src="images/i_271fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">WEST FRONT OF THE PAVILION, 1825.</div>
</div>

<p>'The <em>West Front</em> of this edifice is shewn in all its
variety of detail. In its general character it corresponds
with the Steyne front, but there are many
differences in the minor ornaments. The Perspective
View (drawn from a North West point) exhibits this
front in nearly its entire length; the octagon tower
in the distance is that which encloses the water
reservoir.</p>

<p>'The principal entrance to the palace is constituted
by a Porch and Vestibule, which open from the drive on
the western side of the building. The Porch, which
forms a square of about twenty two feet, is supported at
each angle by three oriental columns, and crowned by
a small dome in the general style of those already
described. Over the cornice is the following inscription,
recording the date when the alterations at the
Pavilion were commenced by Mr. Holland:</p>

<p class="center">
'"<span class="smcap">H.R.H. George. P.W.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap"><small>A.D. MDCCLXXXIV</small>.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>'The Porch leads directly to the Vestibule, which is
of an octagonal form, and about twenty feet in diameter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
It is surmounted by a tented roof, neatly decorated, and
a Chinese lantern is suspended from the centre.</p>

<p>'The Entrance Hall forms a square of twenty six feet,
exclusive of an angular recess which slopes to the
Vestibule. The recess has a tented roof, supported
by two columns in the oriental style, and pierced by a
horizontal sky light, illumined, in parts by tinted glass;
there are also two side windows in the recess, independently
of its glazed doors. The square of the Hall
is surmounted by an ornamental cornice, supporting the
ceiling, which resembles an azure sky, diversified by
fleecy clouds. On the entrance side, below the cornice,
is neatly painted a long range of dragonish forms and
other devices; and four globular lamps, similarly embellished,
are suspended from the angles of the ceiling.
The walls are of a delicate pale green, relieved by
circular and vertical compartments, in which dragons
and serpents are depicted in subdued colouring. The
chimney piece is of white marble, neatly executed.</p>

<p>'The <span class="smcap">Red Drawing Room</span>, which is chiefly used as a
Breakfast Room, adjoins the Entrance Hall on the
south side; its length is about thirty feet, and its
breadth twenty two feet, independently of a considerable
recess towards the north. The timbers which cross
the ceiling are sustained by reeded columns in imitation
of bamboo. A number of small Chinese pictures,
mostly of a bluish tone, exhibiting domestic or family
scenes, ornament the walls, which are painted in resemblance
of the crimson japan.'</p>

<p>The Chinese Gallery&mdash;The Music Room&mdash;The Yellow Drawing-room&mdash;The
Saloon&mdash;The Green Drawing-room.</p></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t1.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">'THE <span class="smcap">Chinese Gallery</span> which ranges immediately
behind the Saloon and its
communicating apartments, is 162 feet
in length, and 17 feet wide. This
space is partially separated into five
divisions, of unequal extent and elevation, by trellis
work in imitation of bamboo.</p>

<p>'The central division is surrounded by a Chinese
Canopy of similar trellis work, hung with bells, and
surmounted by a coved ornamental ceiling, which
projects through the upper floor, and is illumined by a
horizontal light of stained glass, measuring twenty two
feet in length, and eleven feet in width. On this light
is represented <em>Lin-Shin</em>, the god of thunder, surrounded
by his drums, and flying, as described in the mythology
of China. His right hand wields a mace, or sceptre,
"wherewith to strike the drums, and arouse the
thunder"; and, with his left, he apparently upholds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
an elegant glass lamp, ornamentally tinted and enriched
by clusters of brilliant drops. Other sections of the
light exhibit the Imperial five clawed dragon, amidst
fancy borderings of different hues. Vertical transparencies,
in a similar style, in imitative frames of
bamboo, enrich the ends immediately below the ceiling,
and corresponding embellishments are painted on each
side.</p>

<p>'On the west side, beneath the canopy, and directly
facing the middle entrance, is a curiously designed
chimney piece worked in brass and iron to imitate
bamboo; and, over it, is a looking glass of considerable
magnitude. At a little distance, right and left, are
two large niches, lined with yellow marble, containing
cabinets; and, on them, in erect positions, are plaster
casts, painted, of a male and female Chinese figure, in
their proper costume. There are, also, four similar
niches in the other divisions of the gallery, occupied by
Indian cabinets, etc.; as well as two recesses, each containing
a pagoda of six stories, wrought in porcelain.
At various angles of the ceiling, in place of the Chinese
standards, to which they were formerly attached, tasteful
lanterns of stained glass are suspended, exhibiting,
on their respective sides, mythological devices, with
flowers, birds, insects and other ornaments, tinted in a
very effective and striking manner.</p>

<p>'The walls are battened, and the canvas is painted
throughout with a delicate peach blossom, as a ground
colour, on which rocks, trees, shrubs, birds and other
embellishments in the Chinese style are very neatly
pencilled in a subdued tone of pale blue. There are
three fire places, over which stand beautiful jars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
vases of china and porcelain, intermingled with open
tulips and lotus flowers of stained glass, inclosing
branches for lights. Many large jars and other vessels
and figures of China ware, are, also, distributed throughout
the gallery, the furniture of which is entirely of an
oriental description. All the couches and chairs, which
are numerous, are of ivory, curiously figured; and, in
some instances, variegated with black.</p>

<p>'The extreme compartments to the north and south,
are occupied by double Staircases, rendered light and
airy in appearance by the steps being fronted with
perforated brass and iron work; the railings are of cast
iron, wrought and painted to resemble bamboo. These
compartments are illumined by horizontal lights of
stained glass, of similar elevation and accordant adornments
to that of the central division of the Gallery;
the southern one exhibiting the Imperial five clawed
dragon, surrounded by flying bats, and the northern
one the Chinese bird of Royalty called the <em>Fum</em>, with
other ornaments. Above the landing place, at the
north end, are also three windows, each being embellished
with a full sized representation, in stained glass,
of a Chinese god; and corresponding imitative windows
are depicted over the southern landing place. The
staircases lead into an upper gallery, or corridor, which
communicates with the superior bed rooms and other
apartments. When the doors at the ends of the
Gallery, which are fronted with looking glass, are
closed, an almost magical illusion is produced, the perspective
appearing interminable. The carpeting is of
English manufacture, and accords, in decoration, with
the other furniture. From the respective extremities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
this Gallery, access is obtained to the Music Room and
the Banqueting Room.</p>


<p class="center">'<small>THE MUSIC ROOM</small>.</p>

<p>'No verbal description, however elaborate, can convey
to the mind, or imagination of the reader, an appropriate
idea of the magnificence of this apartment; and even
the creative delineations of the pencil, combined with
all the illusions of colour, would scarcely be adequate
to such an undertaking. Yet, luxuriously resplendent
and costly as the adornments are, they are so intimately
blended with the refinements of an elegant taste, that
every thing appears in keeping, and in harmony.</p>

<p>'The ground plan of this apartment forms a square
of forty two feet, enlarged to the north and south by
rectangular recesses, ten feet in depth; thus extending
the entire length to sixty two feet. The square part,
at the height of twenty three feet, is surrounded by a
splendid canopy, or cornice, ornamented with carved
shield work, flower drops, stars, etc.; and supported,
at the angles, by slender, reticulated, tree like columns,
richly gilt. Immediately above this is an octagon gallery,
ten feet high, formed by a series of eight elliptical arches,
pierced by windows of a similar shape, and connected
by intervening spandrils. The windows, which are so
contrived as to be illumined from the exterior, are enriched
with stained glass displaying numerous Chinese
devices, and similar decorations, in green gold, surround
them. A convex cove, four feet in elevation, forms the
next architectural feature, and, upon that, is based a
very elegant dome, or cupola (thirty feet in diameter),
which is faced, throughout, with scale work, in green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
gold, resembling escallop shells; these ornaments, by
decreasing in size as they ascend, add much to the
apparent height of the room, which, at this point, is
forty one feet.</p>

<p>'At the apex, expanding in bold relief and vivid
colouring, is a vast foliated ornament, bearing a general
resemblance to a sunflower, with many smaller flowers
issuing from it, in all the luxuriancy of seeming cultivation.
From this, apparently projected from the calyx,
depends a very beautiful lustre of cut glass, designed in
the pagoda style, and sustaining, by its chain work, an
immense lamp in the form of the <em>Nelumbrium</em>, or Water-lily.
The upper leaves are of white ground glass, edged
with gold, and enriched with transparent devices derived
from the mythology of the Chinese; the lower leaves
are of a pale crimson hue. At the bottom are golden
dragons, in attitudes of flight. Eight smaller lamps,
but of corresponding forms and decoration, are suspended
from the projecting angles of the canopy;
adding greatly to the general effect when illumined
for evening parties.</p>

<p>'On the eastern side of this room, light is admitted
by five windows, the draperies of which, composed of
blue and crimson satins, and yellow silks, richly fringed,
are upheld by golden dragons, and supported, at the
sides, by large serpents of a silvery hue. In front of
the intervening piers (on elevated pedestals, manufactured
by Spode) stand four pagoda towers of oriental
porcelain, each of which consists of eight stories, and
is fifteen feet in height; the pedestals are embellished
with varied landscapes and flowers. Many other rare
and valuable specimens of oriental china and jasper, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
large jars, vases, etc., are included among the ornamental
furniture of this room.</p>

<p>'On the west side is a magnificent chimney piece, of
statuary marble, designed by Westmacott, and very
beautifully wrought. The sweep of cornice in the centre
is supported on the expanded wings of a finely sculptured
dragon; and each of the jambs, which are, in fact, short,
circular columns, having bases and capitals of conjoined
lotus leaves, is surrounded by eight small columns of
<em>ormolu</em>, and otherwise enriched. The stove, fender,
fire irons, etc., which were manufactured by Cutler, in
a superior style of workmanship to most others, are of
polished steel and <em>ormolu</em>. Over the chimney piece is
an effulgent looking glass, measuring nearly twelve feet
by eight, surmounted by a tasteful and glittering canopy,
supported by tree like columns of radiant gold. In
front, stands a superb time piece, of curious and elaborate
design; the base exhibits a rock and a palm-tree; around
the latter a dragon entwines, and appears to be darting
its sting at a figure behind, who wields an uplifted spear.
At the top are Venus and Cupid, with the peacock of
Love; and, below them, is the god Mars, who is climbing
upwards, as though to view the beauties of the
Paphian queen. Large and elegant China vases, with
golden branches for lights, are placed on each side the
time piece, together with other vessels of rich jasper.</p>

<p>'The walls, where not otherwise adorned, are covered
with paintings, in imitation of the crimson japan. The
subjects introduced are twelve in number, and consist of
views in China principally taken in the neighbourhood
of that "far famed, but little known, metropolis"
Pekin; they are of a bright yellow colour, heightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
with gold; and, in delicacy of execution, and beauty
of pencilling, are scarcely to be exceeded by the best
miniature paintings. Much fancy is displayed in the
framework; the inner borderings being composed of a
running pattern of rich foliage, and the outer ones of
blue and yellow fret work, heightened with gold: at
the upper corners are flying dragons.</p>

<p>'The recesses at the north and south ends are each
canopied by a convex curve representing rows of bamboos,
confined by ribands, and terminating in the square of
the room; these are partly sustained by large columns
of crimson and flowered gold, which are entwined by
enormous serpents, depicted in all their glowing diversity
of colour, and vivid expression of animal power. Similar
columns, but of greater height, are ranged on the western
side of this apartment. Within the northern recess,
and a separate room extending behind it to the depth
of twenty feet, stands a large organ, which was built
by Lincoln in the year 1818, and is celebrated both for
great powers, and peculiar delicacy of tone. It has
three rows of keys, twenty eight stops, and twenty
pedals; and its compass extends from C.C.C. with a
double diapason throughout.</p>

<p>'There are two entrances to this apartment, one from
the Chinese Gallery, and the other from the Yellow
Drawing-room, each under a superb canopy of crimson
and gold, ornamented with dragons and musical bells,
and supported by golden columns entwined by dragons.
There is no outlet on the opposite side, but the general
uniformity is preserved by apparent entrances, corresponding
in embellishments with those described.</p>

<p>'The carpet, which was manufactured in Axminster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
to fit the room, is one of the largest in the kingdom,
its dimensions being sixty one feet by forty, and its
weight about 1,700 lbs. It is wrought with Chinese
subjects in gold colour, on a light blue ground, including
suns, stars, serpents, dragons, birds, insects, and other
forms. The sofas and chairs, which are of yellow satin
and gold, accord with the surrounding objects; the
arm chairs are partially dove coloured.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The Yellow Drawing Room</span>, has been so much
altered since it was fitted up by the Prince of Wales,
that it now bears little resemblance to Pugin's drawing
of it. As there delineated, the walls displayed a series
of pictures in the Chinese style, intermingled with other
characteristic embellishments, and numerous Chinese
lanterns were suspended from flying dragons issuing
from the cornice.</p>

<p>'This is the intervening apartment between the
Saloon and the Music Room, and is the one that
usually becomes the sitting room of the Royal party
when residing at the Palace. Its length is fifty six feet,
and its extreme breadth, to the windows, about thirty
three feet. The ceiling is partly supported by two
oriental columns, of white and gold, enwreathed by
serpents, and branching into umbrella capitals hung
with bells. The Cornice, or Canopy, which surrounds
the room, is also diversified by pendent bells.
The draperies, etc., are of striped satin; and the walls
are panelled in white, with richly gilt borderings. The
principal chairs and sofas are covered to match the
drapery; and, on the back of every chair, is a small
Chinese figure, seated, with a bell in each hand. There
are five windows on the east side (besides two others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the semicircular returns), and, in front of each intermediate
pier, is a sexagon stand of porcelain, sustaining
branch lights. The chimney piece, which is of brown
coloured marble, is elegantly designed; at the angles
are small columns, and within a niche in each jamb is a
Chinese figure. On the mantel shelf is a handsome
dial, by Vulliamy, with ornamental accessories, including
Chinese figures of white china, in draperies
enriched with gold. Among the furniture are Buhl
tables, with grotesque borderings, beautifully inlaid.
On the side and end tables are many jars and vases of
Asiatic and Sèvres porcelain; several of which are of a
pale sea green colour, elegantly wrought with flowers,
butterflies, and other forms. The doors are panelled
with plate glass.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The Saloon</span>, which forms the centre of the suite in
the eastern front, is magnificently decorated, almost
every part being effulgent with gold. Its general plan
is a circle, thirty five feet in diameter, surmounted by a
cupola, and enlarged to the north and south by coved
semicircular recesses (of a ten feet radius), which include
the entrances from the apartments communicating with
the Music and Banqueting rooms. The Cupola springs
from a boldly projecting cornice, composed of various
mouldings, apparently, of massive gold, crowned by a
running ornament of flowers, and pendent bells. The
ceiling represents a lightly clouded sky (the sun being
dimly seen); in the centre of which is a gorgeous bird,
in full relief, with wings of flowered gold and silver, enwreathed
with serpents, resplendently coloured crimson
and green. This sustains one of the most elaborate
and finely devised lustres, of cut glass, that was ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
executed. Its height is about eighteen feet, and its
varying and brilliant tiers of glittering drops are surrounded,
towards the bottom, by radiant burners, the
light of which is softened and diffused around by globes
of ground glass. Four smaller lustres, but of corresponding
fancy and workmanship, are pendent from the
ceilings of the recesses.</p>

<p>'On the eastern side are three large windows,
splendidly adorned with festooned curtains of flowered
satin, crimson and gold; and the panels, and other
divisions, are enriched with corresponding drapery.
Between the windows are two very large pier glasses,
reaching nearly from the ground to the cornice; and
other large glasses surmount the entrance doorways;
all the framework is of an elegantly conceived pattern,
designed from the lotus leaf; and every frame has a
rich canopy, springing from dragons' heads. On the
west side is a sumptuous chimney piece of statuary
marble, with enrichments of <em>ormolu</em>; and, in each
jamb, within a niche, stands a Chinese figure; these
figures, which are of metal, are highly painted and
varnished, and the dresses are finely pencilled. Over
the chimney piece is a vast looking glass, thirteen feet
high, and eight feet wide, in front of which stands an
elegant dial by Vulliamy; this is supported by couchant
dragons of blue porcelain, and enclosed in a China case
surrounded by golden wreaths of the lotus and sunflower
plants. Surmounting the dial, is a Chinese male
figure seated, with a boy on his shoulder, a girl at his
side, and a dog on his lap.</p>

<p>'At the sides of the recesses are enriched pilasters;
each shaft of which exhibits a kind of caduceus, en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>wreathed
by double headed serpents, in gold. The
doors, which are folding, and also double, are beautifully
ornamented in Japan work, in panels, curiously
embossed with flowering shrubs, birds of different kinds
(including peacocks, parrots, and cockatoos), rabbits, a
porcupine frightened by snakes, insects, etc., in variously
coloured gold. On the side piers, between the doors,
are represented pagodas in rockery scenery, together
with a lake teeming with water flowers of many species,
and, in the sky, flying dragons. Great invention and
very skilful execution are displayed by all these designs.</p>

<p>'Large vases of china, and other vessels in rich
settings, beautifully wrought with sundry kinds of
insects, in low relief, constitute a part of the ornamental
furniture of the Saloon; which, also, includes
some fine cabinets, and splendid ottomans of ruby
coloured silk, fringed with gold, with couches and chairs
of corresponding elegance. The carpet, which is of
Axminster manufacture, is wrought on a circular plan,
to fit the room, accords with the other decorations. In
the centre is a dragon and two serpents, surrounded by
lotus flowers and leaves; roses, stars, serpents, and
other forms, in alternating succession, diversify the
borderings.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The Green Drawing Room, or Banqueting Room
Gallery</span>, which connects the Banqueting Room with
the Saloon, was originally called the <em>Blue Drawing
Room</em>, from the general tone of its decorations. Chinese
lanterns were suspended from the cornice and ceiling,
and paintings of Chinese scenery and trellis work covered
the walls; but it was, subsequently, altered, and scarcely
a vestige of its former state remains except the stoves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
and chimney pieces. It is now called the <em>Green Drawing
Room</em>, from the prevalent hue of its draperies, which are
of richly woven silks, of a pale green colour, tastefully
wrought with groups of fruit and flowers.</p>

<p>'This apartment is fifty two feet in length, and about
thirty three feet in extreme breadth. The ceiling,
which is surrounded by an enriched cornice, is partly
sustained by two oriental columns, crowned with spreading
foliage. The walls are panelled white, with broad
fret like borders, in gold; and, on the west side, under
a festooned canopy, is a recess for a couch, with fluted
drapery at the back, radiating from a central flower.
On the same side, surmounted by large looking glasses,
are two handsome chimney pieces of white marble,
having ornamental accessories in <em>ormolu</em> and bronze.
A clock by Vulliamy, and two beautiful jars of porcelain,
upholding branch lights, stand on each shelf; and
many other rich vessels of china and porcelain are ranged
on Indian cabinets and side tables, in different parts of
the room. But the most <i lang="fr">récherché</i> of all, are two vases,
and two ewers of Chinese manufacture, which occupy
high pedestals in front of the window piers; they
approach to the Egyptian form, and are of a sea green
colour, variegated with gold; each of these vessels is
about three feet in height. Several of the tables are of
rosewood inlaid with <em>ormolu</em>; and one table is of rich
tortoise shell, similarly embellished. The door panels
are of looking glass.'</p>

<p class="center">'<small>THE BANQUETING ROOM</small>.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i1.png" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">'IN its general plan, dimensions, and
principal architectural features, this
apartment nearly corresponds with the
Music Room; but the decorations and
ornamental work are entirely different,
although equally impressive in effect, from the good
taste displayed in their well harmonized combinations,
and in the professional ability which pervades the
whole.</p>

<p>'Like the Music Room, the square of this apartment,
at the height of twenty three feet, is bounded by a most
elegant cornice, apparently inlaid with pearl and gold:
the upper members exhibit the lotus leaf, and the lower
ones are adorned with pendent trefoils, alternating with
silver bells. This is supported, at the angles, by golden
columns, each surrounded, in two divisions, by fasces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
lances and darts entwined by serpents. Over each side
of the cornice extends an elliptical arch, about seven feet
high in the clear, having, in the central part, a narrow,
oblong window of stained glass (so contrived as to be
illumined from without), and, in smaller arched compartments,
at the extremities, golden dragons of various
forms. The windows, which are glazed lozenge wise,
include in their embellishments radiant suns within
circles, on a blue ground, involving dragons and serpents
in their blaze, in accordance with oriental imagery.
Cove-like spandrils, faced with ornamental fret work,
connect the elliptical arches with a cupola of an unique,
yet graceful form; the base being a regular cone,
about six feet in height, and the surmounting part
composed of curves struck from different centres, and
partly convex. The cove is bordered with gold mouldings,
and faced with scale work of a whitish-green
colour, studded with golden flowerets. An Eastern sky,
partially obscured by the broad and branching foliage
of a luxuriant and fruited plantain tree, is depicted in
the upper part; and, from this, appears to issue a vast
dragon, finely carved, and most brilliantly coloured, the
wings and scales being redolent of metallic green and
silver.</p>

<p>'From a ring, environed by the claws of the dragon,
was, formerly, suspended a magnificent lustre, of unparalleled
size and beauty; but this was taken down,
about three years ago, under the express command of
his late Majesty, King William, who was fearful lest,
from its immense weight, the supports should give way,
and some fatal accident occur. It is still, however,
carefully preserved, and may be replaced, whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
desirable. Its height is thirty feet, its extreme diameter
about twelve feet, and its weight about one ton. This
elaborate specimen of ingenious art consists of two
divisions, connected with each other by chains richly
gilt. The upper division is, apparently, formed of
conjoined links of pearls and rubies diverging to a
horizontal star; below which is a radiant circle of open
flowers and bands of pearls, etc., combined with festoons
of sparkling jewellery. The lower division consists of a
vast bulb, gradually expanding, composed of seeming
pearls, and connected with four large and glittering
dragons, from whose upturned mouths proceed as many
lotus flowers (of ground glass slightly tinted), "the
expressive Eastern emblems of perfection and brightness."
Festoons of pearls, with rosettes, stars, etc., and
tassels of brilliant drops, complete the form of this
unique ornament.</p>

<p>'Four other lustres, designed in a style of corresponding
elegance, but much smaller, and more simple in
construction, are suspended from an equal number of
beautifully carved figures of the Chinese <em>Fum</em>, which
appears to issue, in the act of flight, from the spandrils
beneath the cupola, and are richly and variously
coloured to resemble nature. Each minor lustre displays
only a single lotus flower, which crowns the lower
division, and appears studded, at the joining of the
leaves, with superb jewels; twenty four burners are
contained within the cup of each flower.</p>

<p>'Of the enchanting effect produced by the diffusive
rays of these lustres, when fully illumined, it is scarcely
possible to conceive an adequate idea. "Creating," (if
the figure may be allowed), "in mid air, a diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
blaze, yet so chastened by the semi-transparent medium
through which it streams, that the eye gazes on the
beauteous scene, undazzled; the effulgence assumes the
character of an artificial day.</p>

<p>'The recesses to the north and south of this apartment
are united to the main cornice by convex curves
(rising from a subordinate cornice enriched with gold
and pendent bells), each of which is divided into five
semi-elliptic compartments, curiously embellished with
a variety of shadowy mythological forms, in pale gold,
on a slate coloured ground. The intervening spaces
above the cornice, are crimson and gold, with silver
studs.</p>

<p>'On the east side are five spacious windows, the
draperies of which are of the richest crimson silks,
adorned with gold, and sustained by flying dragons.
The dividing piers are covered by fluted silks of celestial
blue; and, in front of each pier, is a beautiful candelabrum,
about ten feet in height. Each of the latter
consists of a circular pedestal (including descending
dragons, in relief, among its ornaments), supporting a
cylindrical vase of blue porcelain, resembling lapis
lazuli, surmounted by a lotus flower, of seven leaves,
slightly tinged with red, and having its stem entwined
by golden dragons. Similar candelabra, but with varied
pedestals, stand before the main piers on the opposite
side. The windows are glazed with plate glass in large
panes, set in frames of dark wood, with gold beadings,
and borders of amber coloured glass; the jambs are
black and red, edged with gold ornamental work.</p>

<p>'There are four entrances to this apartment (<em>viz.</em>,
two at each end), all of which are uniform in character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and decoration. They have folding doors embellished
in imitation of Japan work; each leaf presenting an
elegant pagoda, embossed with gold of different hues,
and hung with silver bells. Small columns ornament
the sides of the doorways, and each impost exhibits two
finely carved dragons, apparently of solid gold. Above
these, in an arched compartment, is a group of dragons,
issuing from an expanded flower cup, expressive of the
chimæra of oriental mythology: these, also, are richly
gilt, and beautifully sculptured.</p>

<p>'The walls above the dado (independently of a general
decoration of silver chequer work, heightened with
flowered crosses, on a deep blue ground) are divided
into compartments of large size, containing a series of
beautiful paintings in illustration of the domestic
manners and costume of the Chinese people. The
grouped subjects are eleven in number, and there are
four others of single figures, holding screens of peacock's
feathers. The ground of these masterly productions
is an imitation of inlaid pearl, richly and ingeniously
wrought with all the varied forms of the mythology of
China; yet so delicately executed as scarcely to intrude
upon the eye. The central picture on the west side
represents the conveyance home of a Chinese bride. She
is seated in a palanquin, under a parasol canopy, with a
peacock by her side, and carried by six bearers in rich
habits. An attendant with cymbals, and two boys,
respectively carrying a banner and a trumpet, lead the
procession. In the adjoining are a lady looking at a
vase containing gold fish, which an attendant is feeding,
and a Chinese grandee giving audience to a suitor. On
the same side, but within the recesses, family parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
are represented, in one of which is a female on a settee,
with two children, and, at her knee, a boy playfully
holding a macaw. Among the other subjects represented
are, a lady playing on a guitar, with a much pleased
child, kneeling at her side, and listening; a lady, with
a peacock fan, receiving fruit from a boy; a lady and
child tending flowers; and a child amusing itself with
a tame snake, in the presence of its parents. These
paintings are executed with a precision and delicacy
equal to miniature, and the colouring is extremely
brilliant: the figures are nearly the size of life; and the
dresses are richly embroidered. They are all inclosed
within painted framings of trellis work, edged by narrow
gold mouldings. On the west side are, also, painted
two Chinese standards, hung with pennons, and guarded,
at the base, by dragons.</p>

<p>'At each end of this room (facing each other) is a
chimney piece of the finest statuary marble, ornamented
with <em>ormolu</em>, and having canopied niches in the jambs,
occupied by Chinese figures, richly gilt. Above each is
a looking glass, extending to the cornice, and measuring
ten feet in height, by five feet nine inches in width.
Before the northern glass stands a time piece, of most
excellent design and workmanship. The dial forms the
centre of an opening sunflower, on each side of which,
as though reposing in the shade of its exuberant and
varied foliage (chased in gold), is a Chinese figure, male
and female, the one with a bow, the other with a fan.
These figures are of brass, highly coloured in beautiful
Japan work; and the garments are enriched with golden
ornaments, finely pencilled. On the opposite chimney
piece is a thermometer, of similar design and execution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
as the time piece: each dial is surmounted by a peacock,
or <em>Fum</em>.</p>

<p>'There are five sideboards of rose wood in this apartment,
ornamented with <em>ormolu</em> and Chinese emblems.
The dining table, which is of the best mahogany, is
forty two feet in length, and seven feet six inches in
width. The seats and backs of the chairs are covered
with red morocco.</p>

<p>'Among the other furniture appropriate to a dining
room, are five Chinese Cisterns, mounted in <em>ormolu</em>, of
superior workmanship; and numerous jars and vessels
of blue porcelain, of great brilliancy and excellence;
the latter are of Staffordshire manufacture, and were
provided by Spode and Copeland. The carpeting, which
is of Axminster manufacture, and made expressly for
the room, consists of a large square, and two end pieces
to correspond. A dragon, with three serpents coiled
round, and involving it, forms the central ornament:
this is surrounded by circles, diversely wrought, and
increasing in diameter towards the border.</p>

<p>'The illustration represents the Banqueting Room as
it appeared during one of the splendid entertainments
given there, by the Prince Regent; whose portrait may
be distinctly recognised among the company.</p>

<p>'On the same side, at the end of the dining table, is
his Royal brother, the late King, when Duke of Clarence.
The table is set out with rich plate, splendid candelabra,
and elegant and costly statuary.</p>


<p class="center">'<small>THE LIBRARY</small>.</p>

<p>'Behind the Music Room, and, partly, forming the
north west of this edifice, are the private apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
which were occupied by his late Majesty, George the
Fourth. They consist of a Library, Bed room, Bath,
Sitting and Dressing rooms, and several offices.</p>

<p>'The Library comprehends two rooms, the largest of
which is thirty five feet in length, by twenty feet in
breadth, and the other, about half those dimensions.
Divided into three compartments, <em>viz.</em> a square and two
oblongs, the ceiling of the large room is painted to
represent an azure sky, diversified by light clouds; and,
in the oblong compartments, are delineations of Chinese
standards. The square part is surrounded by a gilt
cornice, supported, at the angles, by fluted pillars,
crowned with capitals of fan-like tracery. Dragons of
grotesque and varied forms, combined with flowers and
other devices, on a green ground, are curiously painted
on the walls. The hangings are composed of rich yellow
coloured drapery. Over the chimney piece, which is of
statuary marble, and very elegant, is a splendid looking
glass; and another is fixed over the chimney piece in
the smaller room. Though still called the Library,
these apartments present but few indications of that
appropriation, all the books having been removed during
the residence, here, of William the Fourth. A great
variety of China jars, and other vessels, form a part of
the ornamental furniture, and, in the smaller room, is a
very pretty Indian Cabinet, containing numerous articles
of <i lang="fr">bijouterie</i> and <i lang="fr">vertû</i>.</p>


<p class="center">'<small>HIS MAJESTY'S (GEORGE THE FOURTH) BEDROOM.</small></p>

<p>'This apartment adjoins to the Library, on the north
side: it forms a square of about forty feet, with a recess
for a bed on the eastern side. A kind of dado of trellis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
work surrounds the lower part, and the upper parts are
decorated with dragons, stars, flowers, etc., pencilled in
white, on a light green ground: the doors, also, are
painted to correspond. The adjoining <em>Bath Room</em> is
lined white marble: the principal bath, which is sixteen
feet long, ten feet wide, and six feet deep, is supplied
with salt water from the sea, by a succession of pipes,
and other machinery. In the Ante room (or Page's
room) are eighteen small paintings, very neatly executed,
of Chinese Landscapes, and other subjects connected
with China.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The North and South Galleries</span>, or <span class="smcap">Lobbies</span>, as
they are now called, serve as avenues of communication
with the adjoining apartments. From the trellis work
and general style of fitting up, they have a light and
airy appearance, and the furniture is correspondent.
Each doorway is flanked by two half columns, ornamented
by lozenge-shaped reticulations, and crowned by dragons'
heads in relief. Several models of Chinese ships and
Pagodas, finely carved in ivory, are preserved here, and
exhibit extraordinary examples of patient labour and
dexterity in that branch of art.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Queen Adelaide's Apartments</span>, are very neatly
fitted up, though with little splendour; being far more
adapted for domestic comfort than for state display;
for which, indeed, they were never designed. Both the
Drawing and Bed-rooms are battened with a very
handsome paper, teeming with flowers upon a yellow
ground, and including many beautiful parrots and other
birds and insects among its other ornaments. Several
Indian cabinets, and an elegant Buhl table, form part of
the Drawing room furniture; and, in the adjoining Lady's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Room, is a fine head, by Lawrence, of his late Majesty,
William the Fourth. These apartments open to the
balcony in the West Wing, over the Library.</p>


<p class="center">'<small>GREAT KITCHEN.</small></p>

<p>'Nearly the whole of the south end of the Palace is
occupied by the various offices belonging to the establishment,&mdash;of
which, both in appearance, and interest,
the <em>Great Kitchen</em> must be regarded as the principal.
Its form is rectangular; the extent from east to west is
about forty-five feet, and, from north to south, thirty-six
feet. It has a lantern roof, which is supported by
four iron columns, in the shape of palm trees, and is
carried up to a considerable elevation. The interior of
this necessary adjunct to social comfort is to be seen in
a contemporary illustration, wherein its busy inmates
are seen in active preparation for a Royal entertainment.
The dishes, when placed on the central table,
are kept hot by a steam apparatus, until everything is
ready for the banquet. Several smaller kitchens, and
two larders, are attached to the principal one; and, on
the western side of the servants' corridor, are two pastry
rooms and a confectionary. Some alterations were
made here about two years ago, during a repair. It is
scarcely necessary to add, that all the arrangements,
fittings up and furniture of these offices, as well as the
great variety of articles of culinary use, are of the best
and most convenient description. In an open court,
there is, also, an octagon tower, containing a water
reservoir; the water is raised and supplied for domestic
purposes, by ingenious and powerful machinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">'<span class="smcap">The Chapel.</span></p>

<p>'Near the south east angle of the palace is a large
building of red brick, forming part of Castle Square.
This was, originally, the Castle Inn; but, it having
been purchased by the Prince Regent, the Ball room
was converted into a <span class="smcap">Chapel</span> for the Royal household,
soon after his accession to the Crown. It was consecrated
with great solemnity, on the 1st of January,
1822, by the late Dr. John Buckner, Bishop of
Chichester, in the presence of the King and his suite,
and a numerous congregation. The interior forms a
rectangle of eighty feet by forty; the height is about
thirty feet. The Royal gallery, which is at the north
end, is supported by fluted columns and pilasters, and
hung with crimson drapery: it includes three divisions,
the central one being for the sovereign, and those to the
right and left, for the attendant ladies and gentlemen.
At the south end is a large organ gallery, with seats for
the household servants. The area is appropriated to a
general congregation, but no person is admitted without
a ticket: the number of tickets issued is about 400.
The chapel is neatly wainscoted; and has two fire
places on each side: it communicates with the Palace
by a covered passage leading to an apartment adjoining
the Banqueting room. The original Chapel Royal was
in Prince's Place, North Street, at a short distance
westward from the Pavilion; and it is still occupied as
a Chapel of ease to Brighton. It was erected in 1793,
under the patronage of the Prince of Wales, who
deposited the first stone; and contains accommodation
for about 1,000 persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">'<span class="smcap">The Royal Stables.</span></p>

<p>'It has already been stated that the Pavilion Stables
were erected from the designs of the late William
Porden, Esq<sup>re</sup>, between the years 1803 and 1805. They
stand on the northern side of the pleasure grounds, at
the distance of about ninety or one hundred yards from
the Palace itself, and occupy a part of the site of the
Elm, or Promenade Grove, which had, for some years,
been used as a place of public recreation, and was purchased
by the Prince of Wales, in 1800. Shortly afterwards,
the adjoining shrubberies and grounds of Grove
House, belonging to the Duke of Marlborough, were
also purchased; and, in consequence of those acquisitions,
the <em>New Road</em>, connecting North Street with
Church Street, was made. The thoroughfare connecting
East Street with the North Steyne (which had, previously,
run immediately behind the Pavilion) was
then closed up, and the intervening space annexed to
the demesne.</p>

<p>'The arrangement and construction of this extensive
pile are highly honourable to the professional skill of
its talented architect, who was the first person in this
country that adopted the Oriental style in modern
composition; at least, on an enlarged scale. In the
boldness of the design, particularly of the dome crowned
Rotunda, and in the judicious allocation of the parts,
"which" (as was justly remarked by a contemporary
writer), "while they produce all the conveniences in
the contemplation of his Royal Highness, contribute,
equally, to advance the general effect," the architect
has been eminently successful; yet, as correct speci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>mens
of Oriental composition, neither the Pavilion,
nor Stables, will be ever regarded as examples for imitation.
The expense of erecting this building was upwards
of £70,000.</p>

<p>'The principal entrance to the Royal Stables is from
Church Street, and leads through a wide and lofty arch,
of the pointed form, into a spacious quadrangular court,
containing the coach houses, coach house stabling, and
various servants' rooms and offices. Opposite to this,
is another archway, conducting to the area of the
Rotunda, which is a circle of 249 feet in circumference,
surrounded by the stables for the saddle horses, and an
open gallery; and the whole of which receives its light
through the glazed compartments of the vast cupola by
which it is surmounted. From the extent and height
of this interior, and the lofty elevation of the four
arches which open from it towards the cardinal points,
an impressive effect, associated with surprise and admiration,
is produced on the mind of every spectator.</p>

<p>'The Dome, or Cupola, which surmounts the Rotunda,
combines strength and lightness in an extraordinary
degree. Although upwards of eighty feet diameter in
the clear, its thickness is only twelve inches at the
bottom, and nine inches at the top. It is constructed
on the same principle as was the celebrated Cupola of
the <i lang="fr">Halle au Blé</i> at Paris, and it was the first example
of that mode of construction, in this country, upon a
large scale. The main ribs, which are twenty-four in
number, are twelve inches by nine inches at the bottom,
diminishing to nine inches square at the top; they are
each constructed of three thicknesses of fir planks, in
lengths of nine feet, breaking joint, and firmly bolted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
together, every three feet; the whole planed smooth,
and the heading joints fitted together with the greatest
accuracy. Of the space between the ribs, by far the
largest proportion is divided into sixteen glazed compartments,
spreading fan wise, which diffuse an abundant
light throughout the Rotunda. The remaining eight
compartments are embellished with panels in stucco
work, instead of glass, which adds variety, without
destroying the symmetry, and relieves the eye from the
repulsive glare that a skylight of that magnitude must,
otherwise, produce. In the middle of the Cupola is a
circular opening, surmounted by a lantern, which forms
a ventilator for the Rotunda and Stabling, and is
wrought, exteriorly, in the form of a coronet. Where
not interrupted by the skylights, the ribs are connected
by horizontal purlins, and further strengthened by iron
chains surrounding the whole contour. The curvilinear
plate, or curb, at the springing of the dome, measures
twelve inches by nine inches, and that at the top, nine
inches by nine; both are constructed in thicknesses in
the same manner as the ribs above described.</p>

<p>'The great arches on the east and west of the Rotunda
lead to the Riding House, and to a new wing of
stablings, erected in 1832, for Queen Adelaide, on the
site of what had been intended for a Tennis Court.
They, also, contain the staircases connected with the
gallery, around which are the Harness and Saddle
rooms, and numerous apartments for the grooms and
other servants. The southern arch opens to the
pleasure grounds, and the view through the arches,
from the entrance gateway, across the Rotunda, is
singularly striking. The stables, surrounding the area,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
forty-four in number, are so arranged that, when the
doors are open, a spectator, standing under the central
part of the Cupola, may see into every stall, without
changing his situation. The fronts of the stables, and
the arcades of the surmounting gallery, are finished in
a corresponding manner to the dome, and this gives an
harmonious character to the whole interior.</p>

<p>'It has been frequently stated that the ventilation of
the Royal stables, though aided by extensive archways
connected with the Rotunda, was inadequate to disperse
the heat attracted, and retained, by the glass and
lead work covering the dome; and, that the health of
all horses kept there for any length of time was much
injured in consequence. These assertions, however, are
contrary to facts; the writer having been recently
assured by the chief groom, who has held his situation
many years, that no stabling in the kingdom can be
more healthful, nor better adapted for its purpose than
this.</p>

<p>'The <span class="smcap">Riding House</span>, which is to the west of the
Rotunda, is a very capacious building; its length being
176 feet, its width 58 feet 6 inches, and its height
34 feet, in the clear. It is covered with a roof of a
peculiar construction, differing, probably, from every
other example. For the purpose of gaining as much
height as possible, this roof was constructed without the
beams, the main timbers, of twelve inches by nine inches
scantling, being built in the form of an arch, of forty-seven
feet six inches radius, in three thicknesses of fir
plank; precisely in the same manner as the ribs of the
dome, above described. These curvilinear beams rest

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">GEORGE the Magnificent was buried on
July 16, 1830, and at the earliest
opportunity his brother and successor
William the Fourth visited the Pavilion
(August 16), and at once began to plan
alterations. The following is the account, from the
<cite>Brighton Herald</cite> of August 21, of his reception:</p>

<p>'On Monday last, it being generally known that his
Majesty would arrive at the Palace on that day, the
town, at an early hour, was in full bustle and active
preparation for receiving the Sovereign; and, by two
o'clock, the various public bodies and institutions were
assembled, and proceeded to take up their stations on
the line of road by which the King would pass, as
allotted to them by a Committee appointed at a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
meeting, on Saturday, to conduct the various matters.
By three o'clock, Brighton had poured forth its
thousands of every grade, and dense masses of people
flanked the road, from the Palace gates to Preston, and
even beyond; while vehicles of every description, from
the gay barouche of the Peer, to the humble hackney
fly, formed a continuous line for nearly a mile. The
manner in which the various authorities were stationed
to receive his Majesty, was as follows:</p>

<p>'At the Palace gates,&mdash;the local Magistrates, the
High Constable, and the Clergy, in their Canonicals; at
St. George's Place, the body of the Commissioners and
their officers; opposite St. Peter's Church, the Overseers,
Directors, and Guardians; at the Elephant and
Castle, the Revenue Officers; at the Hare and Hounds,
the Friendly and Benefit Societies of the town; and,
from the Dairy to Preston, the children of the various
Charity Schools.</p>

<p>'Precisely at half past four o'clock, a gun, fired from
the battery, announced to the expectant multitude that
their Royal Prince was approaching; and, soon after,
one of the Royal carriages, containing his Majesty's
pages, arrived. Twenty minutes elapsed, when the
acclamations of the distant throng made known that
the King, himself, had appeared.</p>

<p>'At Preston, the King, in his travelling chariot,
(the glasses of which were down) accompanied by Sir
Frederick Watson, entered, amidst huzzas, the line
which had been formed, when his Majesty, to meet the
wishes of his delighted people, directed the postilions to
proceed at a walking pace.</p>

<p>'The King, who looked extremely well, and was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the highest spirits, acknowledged the loyal gratulations
and respectful obeisances, with which he was, on both
sides, saluted, frequently bending to the elegant and
beautiful females who filled the balconies and windows,
waving their handkerchiefs as he passed.</p>

<p>'The line of road was pretty well kept, until his
Majesty had nearly cleared Marlborough Place, when
the anxiety of the crowd, who stood in the back ground,
in Church Street, to see the King, was not to be withstood;
and, despite the endeavour of the Headborough
and Committee, the populace rushed in, and the Royal
carriage was literally beset: and it was with extreme
difficulty that the postilions wended their way through
the dense crowds, who rent the air with deafening
acclamations, which were continued for a considerable
time after the King had entered the Palace Gates.</p>

<p>'<i>Never was a monarch more heartily and joyfully
welcomed, than was William the Fourth, on Monday last,
by the inhabitants of this town.</i>'<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Poor Florizel! only absent a little more than three
years from the town which he had made; superseded in
a moment by another rising sun, and all but clean forgotten;
and even his own brother, as soon as he possibly
could, began alterations on poor Florizel's Folly!</p>

<p>'His Majesty, as early as nine o'clock the next morning
after his arrival, attended by Sir Frederick Watson,
and Mr. Nash, walked from the Palace Grounds to the
gravelled space outside the south gate of the Palace,
fronting East Street, where he continued for some time,
familiarly conversing, and marking the ground with his
stick, evidently suggesting certain alterations; after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
which, his Majesty and attendants retired into the
Palace. It is conjectured that the unsightly boards,
which hide from public view the western front of the
Palace, and the beautiful grounds, will be removed, and
a light iron fence and gates, extending from Messrs.
Brewster and Seabrook's to the Royal Kitchen, will be
substituted in lieu thereof.'</p>

<p>A few days afterwards (on August 30), the King,
with Queen Adelaide, visited Brighton, and stayed at
the Pavilion until October 25. Anent this visit, I
cannot refrain from quoting an anecdote of the present
Duke of Cambridge, who was then not twelve years
old.</p>

<p><cite>Brighton Herald, October 2, 1830.</cite>&mdash;'The following
has been related to us as a fact: A few days since,
Prince George of Cambridge went into a saddler's shop,
in the King's Road, and requested to be shewn some
whips. An assortment being produced, his Royal Highness
selected one of costly manufacture, and enquired
the price. The cautious shopkeeper, ignorant of the
rank of his visitor, stated the charge, and added:
"Perhaps, Sir, you had better consult your friends
before you purchase so expensive an article." The
Prince, with infinite good humour, acquiesced, and left
the shop; and a servant was, soon after, sent for the
whip, and announced to the astonished saddler the
name of his customer.'</p>

<p>The Pavilion was altered and added to according to
the King's instructions; in 1831 the southern gateway
and the dormitories were completed, as were the northern
gateway and Queen Adelaide's stables in the next year.
The Queen was very fond of Brighton, and the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
visits were frequent. None, however, deserve a notice,
except, perhaps, that which commenced on October 19,
1836, the only noteworthy episode in which was that
on Saturday, December 24, the whole royal establishment
were unable to stir forth owing to the very heavy
fall of snow. Several people were frozen to death; the
theatre was closed, and no carriages, except in cases of
absolute necessity, left the town. One short paragraph
out of a long account in the <cite>Brighton Patriot</cite> of December
27, 1836, will suffice to show the severity of the
storm:</p>

<p>'The King's messenger left the Palace, with despatches,
for London, on Sunday evening; but, when he had arrived
at Patcham, he was compelled to leave the carriage;
he then took horse, and proceeded towards London. A
gentleman left in a postchaise and pair, about the same
time, in spite of the most pressing remonstrances. On
the other side of Clayton Hill, the carriage and horses
were buried in the snow. The gentleman and driver,
it is understood, with great difficulty reached the
Friar's Oak, leaving the horses in the snow; and it is
said, they have both perished. The London Mail left
on the same evening, at the usual time; but, having
got to Patcham, it returned, the road being impassable;
but the mail bags were taken on by a man on
horseback.'</p>

<p>The old King was then ill with the gout, and he
died on June 20, 1837, and it was not long after her
accession that Queen Victoria visited the Pavilion. She
came to Brighton on October 4, and left November 4.
It is needless to say that she received an ovation, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
may be tersely expressed in the following acrostic taken
from the <cite>Brighton Gazette</cite> of October 5, 1837:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'View now the crowds who throng the joyous scene,</div>
<div class="verse">In anxious hope to greet our youthful Queen;</div>
<div class="verse">Can loyal hearts their joy now fail to show?</div>
<div class="verse">To Heaven the shouts ascend of all below.</div>
<div class="verse">O! may thy reign with every bliss be crowned,</div>
<div class="verse">Round the vast world may thy renown abound,</div>
<div class="verse">In Brighton, may'st thou health and peace acquire,</div>
<div class="verse">And Heaven grant thee all thy heart's desire.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Her Majesty's next visit to the Pavilion was in the
following year, arriving on December 18, and keeping
Christmas there. The Queen married in 1840, but did
not visit Brighton until February 10, 1842, when she
and Prince Albert, together with the Prince of Wales
and the Princess Royal, paid a visit to the Pavilion.
A notice of this visit, in the <cite>Brighton Herald</cite> of
February 12, says:</p>

<p>'In the third carriage came the infant Prince of
Wales and the Princess Royal, for whose failing health,
it is said, this journey has been made: and never has it
been our lot to witness a more interesting scene. The
Prince, a fine chubby little fellow, was held up by his
nurse to the right window, so as to be visible to every
one, and he appeared to return the gaze of the thousands
who were looking on him and hailing him, with almost
as much joy as they felt. On the opposite side, the
Princess Royal was displayed in a similar manner, and
received with equal enthusiasm. Indeed, her Majesty
must feel that she enjoys a double existence in these
Royal infants, who call forth from her subjects so large
a share of loyalty and love.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>This visit terminated on March 8.</p>

<p>In September, 1843, the Queen and Prince Albert
paid visits to the Kings of France and Belgium, and
the royal children were sent to Brighton; but the Queen
and Prince Albert paid them a visit at the Pavilion
on September 7, stopping till the 12th. This was the
Queen's fourth and last visit to Brighton.</p>

<p>The royal children&mdash;the Prince of Wales, the Princess
Alice, and Prince Alfred&mdash;were sent to the Pavilion
next year, on September 10, and stopped till October 2.
This was the last time the building was used as a royal
residence.</p>

<p>A marine palace with greater privacy was considered
necessary, and, as Osborne fulfilled the requirements,
the Pavilion was doomed. In August, 1846, it was
rumoured it was to be sold, and we see, from the following
cutting from <cite>Punch</cite> of August 22, what was thought
of it:</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Rubbish for Sale.</span>&mdash;As there is a doubt about a
purchaser coming forward to bid for the Pavilion at
Brighton, we suggest that it be bought up for the
Chinese Collection, unless No. One St. Paul's<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> should
purchase it for their tea establishment. We know of
no other purpose it could be turned to; and, with a few
paper lanterns, and a real native at the door, we feel
confident a deal of business in selling tea, or exhibiting
curiosities, might be done. If it is pulled down, it will
be a fine specimen of broken china.'</p>

<p>From 1846 to 1848 the Pavilion was quietly dismantled,
and in the latter year the organ was presented
to the town. In June, 1849, leave was given to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
a Bill into the House of Commons for its sale, and the
town was given the option of purchasing it for £53,000,
although Messrs. Cubitt were prepared to give £100,000
for the site for building purposes. On June 13, 1850,
the town paid £53,000 to the Commissioners of Woods
and Forests, and possession was given them on June 19.
Thackeray, speaking of it in 1861, says:</p>

<p>'You may see the place now for sixpence: they have
fiddlers there every day; and, sometimes, buffoons and
mountebanks hire the Riding House and do their tricks
and tumbling there.'</p>
